== Data Sources in Spark

Spark can access data from many data sources, including http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html[Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)], http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra], http://hbase.apache.org/[HBase], https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[S3] and many more.

Spark offers different APIs to read data based upon the content and the storage.

There are two groups of data based upon the content:

* binary
* text

You can also group data by the storage:

* link:spark-io.adoc[files]
* databases, e.g. link:spark-cassandra.adoc[Cassandra]
