== Data Sources in Spark

Spark offers different APIs to read data based upon the content and the storage.

There are two groups of data based upon the content:

* binary
* text

You can also group data by the storage:

* link:spark-files.adoc[files]
* databases, e.g. link:spark-cassandra.adoc[Cassandra]
