== Broadcast variables

*Broadcast* is a part of Spark responsible for broadcasting information in a cluster.

Spark comes with a BitTorrent implementation.

It is not enabled by default.

* `sc.broadcast`
* Use large broadcasted HashMaps over RDDs whenever possible and leave RDDs with a key to lookup necessary data -- FIXME: elaborate why
