== Broadcast Variables

From http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables[the official documentation about Broadcast Variables]:

> Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks.

And later in the document:

> Explicitly creating broadcast variables is only useful when tasks across multiple stages need the same data or when caching the data in deserialized form is important.

To use a broadcast value in a transformation you have to create it first using <<sparkcontext-broadcast, SparkContext.broadcast()>> and then use `value` method to access the shared value. Learn it in <<introductory-example, Introductory Example>>.

The Broadcast feature in Spark uses SparkContext to create broadcast values and link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc[BroadcastManager] and link:spark-service-contextcleaner.adoc[ContextCleaner] to manage their lifecycle.

=== [[introductory-example]] Introductory Example

Let's start with an introductory example to check out how to use broadcast variables and build your initial understanding.

You're going to use a static mapping of interesting projects with their websites, i.e. `Map[String, String]` that the tasks, i.e. closures (anonymous functions) in transformations, use.

```
scala> val pws = Map("Apache Spark" -> "http://spark.apache.org/", "Scala" -> "http://www.scala-lang.org/")
pws: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String] = Map(Apache Spark -> http://spark.apache.org/, Scala -> http://www.scala-lang.org/)

scala> val websites = sc.parallelize(Seq("Apache Spark", "Scala")).map(pws).collect
...
websites: Array[String] = Array(http://spark.apache.org/, http://www.scala-lang.org/)
```

It works, but is very ineffective as the `pws` map is sent over the wire to executors while it could have been there already. If there were more tasks that need the `pws` map, you could improve their performance by minimizing the number of bytes that are going to be sent over the network for task execution.

Enter broadcast variables.

```
scala> val pwsB = sc.broadcast(pws)
INFO MemoryStore: Ensuring 1048576 bytes of free space for block broadcast_8(free: 771881313, max: 771883008)
INFO MemoryStore: Ensuring 360 bytes of free space for block broadcast_8(free: 771881313, max: 771883008)
INFO MemoryStore: Block broadcast_8 stored as values in memory (estimated size 360.0 B, free 2.0 KB)
INFO MemoryStore: Ensuring 205 bytes of free space for block broadcast_8_piece0(free: 771880953, max: 771883008)
INFO MemoryStore: Block broadcast_8_piece0 stored as bytes in memory (estimated size 205.0 B, free 2.2 KB)
INFO BlockManagerInfo: Added broadcast_8_piece0 in memory on localhost:54142 (size: 205.0 B, free: 736.1 MB)
INFO SparkContext: Created broadcast 8 from broadcast at <console>:26
pwsB: org.apache.spark.broadcast.Broadcast[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String]] = Broadcast(8)

scala> val websites = sc.parallelize(Seq("Apache Spark", "Scala")).map(pwsB.value).collect
...
websites: Array[String] = Array(http://spark.apache.org/, http://www.scala-lang.org/)
```

Semantically, the two computations - with and without the broadcast value - are exactly the same, but the broadcast-based one wins performance-wise when there are more executors spawned to execute many tasks that use `pws` map.

=== [[introduction]] Introduction

*Broadcast* is a part of Spark responsible for broadcasting information in a cluster.

Spark comes with a BitTorrent implementation.

It is not enabled by default.

* Use large broadcasted HashMaps over RDDs whenever possible and leave RDDs with a key to lookup necessary data -- FIXME: elaborate why

=== [[sparkcontext-broadcast]] SparkContext.broadcast

Read about `SparkContext.broadcast` method in link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-broadcast-variables[Creating broadcast variables].
