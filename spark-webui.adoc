== WebUI - UI for Spark Monitoring

You use WebUI (aka _web UI_) to monitor Apache Spark.

Spark comes with WebUI that is very useful for daily monitoring. As a matter of fact, every SparkContext launches its own web UI that is by default available at http://[master]:4040 (the port can be changed using `spark.ui.port` setting).

If multiple SparkContexts are running on the same host (it's not possible to have two or more on a single JVM, though), they will bind to successive ports beginning with `spark.ui.port` (defaults to `4040`, and move on to 4041, 4042, etc.)

It offers pages (tabs) with the following information:

* tasks and stages scheduling
* RDD size and memory use
* link:spark-execution-model.adoc#executor[executor] information
* System Environment

This information is available only until the application is running by default.

You can view the web UI after the fact after setting link:spark-scheduler-listeners.adoc#event-logging[spark.eventLog.enabled] to `true` before starting the
application.

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.ui.enabled` (default: `true`) setting controls whether the web UI is started at all.
