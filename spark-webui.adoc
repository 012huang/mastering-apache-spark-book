== WebUI for Spark Monitoring

In this section, you will learn how to configure, monitor and tune Apache Spark.

Spark comes with WebUI that is very useful for daily monitoring. It's by default available at http://[master]:4040 (the port can be changed using `spark.ui.port` setting)

It offers pages (tabs) with the following information:

* tasks and stages scheduling
* RDD size and memory use
* link:spark-execution-model.adoc#executor[executor] information
* System Environment
