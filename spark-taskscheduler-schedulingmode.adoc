== [[SchedulingMode]] Scheduling Mode

`SchedulingMode` (aka *order task policy*) describes a policy to order tasks.

NOTE: The scheduling mode in `TaskSchedulerImpl` is configured by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#spark.scheduler.mode[spark.scheduler.mode] setting.

`SchedulingMode` can be one of the following values:

* *FIFO* with no pools; one root pool with instances of link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager]; lower priority gets link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulable] sooner or earlier stage wins.
* *FAIR*
* *NONE* means no sub-queues

TIP: Refer to link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[SchedulableBuilder].
