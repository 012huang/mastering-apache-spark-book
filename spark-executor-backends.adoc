== Executor Backends

*Executor Backends* manage link:spark-executor.adoc[executors]. An executor backend acts as a bridge between the driver and an executor, i.e. there are two endpoints running.

.ExecutorBackends work on executors and communicate with driver

At startup, it connects to the driver and creates an executor. It then launches and kills tasks. It stops when the driver orders so.

It asks the driver for the driver's Spark properties

There are the following types of executor backends:

* local executor backend
* <<CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend, CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend>>
** used for YARN and coarse-grained mode in Mesos
* Mesos executor backend

==== [[CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend]] CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend

CAUTION: FIXME `org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` object comes with `main`. Where is this used?

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME Review the use of:

** Used in `SparkContext.createTaskScheduler`
* `SparkClassCommandBuilder`

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` logging level for `org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend=TRACE
```
