== Executor Backends

*Executor Backend* is a pluggable interface used by link:spark-executor.adoc[executors] to send status updates to a cluster scheduler. It effectively becomes a bridge between the driver and an executor, i.e. there are two endpoints running.

Status updates include information about tasks, i.e. task id, link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc#states[state], and data (as `ByteBuffer`).

CAUTION: FIXME What is cluster scheduler? Where is ExecutorBackend used?

.ExecutorBackends work on executors and communicate with driver

At startup, an executor backend connects to the driver and creates an executor. It then launches and kills tasks. It stops when the driver orders so.

It asks the driver for the driver's Spark properties

There are the following types of executor backends:

* link:spark-local.adoc#LocalBackend[LocalBackend] used in local mode
* <<CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend, CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend>>
** used for YARN and coarse-grained mode in Mesos
* <<MesosExecutorBackend, MesosExecutorBackend>>

=== [[CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend]] CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend

CAUTION: FIXME `org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` object comes with `main`. Where is this used?

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME Review the use of:

** Used in `SparkContext.createTaskScheduler`
* `SparkClassCommandBuilder`

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` logging level for `org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend=TRACE
```

=== [[MesosExecutorBackend]] MesosExecutorBackend
