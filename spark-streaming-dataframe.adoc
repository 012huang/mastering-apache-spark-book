== Streaming DataFrames

NOTE: Watch the video https://youtu.be/oXkxXDG0gNk[The Future of Real Time in Spark] from Spark Summit East 2016 in which Reynold Xin first presents the concept of *Streaming DataFrames* to the public.

*Streaming DataFrames* are infinite dataframes that is slated to be available in Spark 2.0.

*Structured Streaming* is a high-level streaming API over Spark SQL engine.

It is supposed to unify streaming, interactive, and batch queries.

Every *trigger* (time) a computation on DataFrames should be performed.

Why did Reynold speak about DataFrames (not Datasets)?
