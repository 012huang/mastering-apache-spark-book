== JobProgressListener

`JobProgressListener` is link:spark-scheduler-listeners.adoc[SparkListener] for web UI.

It listens to Spark events to present progress of Spark application in Spark UI.

CAUTION: FIXME What information does this track?

=== [[schedulingMode]] schedulingMode Attribute

`schedulingMode` attribute is used to show the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[scheduling mode] for the Spark application in link:spark-webui.adoc[Spark UI].

When `SparkListenerEnvironmentUpdate` comes, `JobProgressListener` looks up `spark.scheduler.mode` key in `Spark Properties` map to set the internal `schedulingMode` field.

NOTE: It is used in Jobs and Stages tabs.

CAUTION: FIXME When is `SparkListenerEnvironmentUpdate` sent out to listeners?
