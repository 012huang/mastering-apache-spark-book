= Mastering Apache Spark

Welcome to Mastering Apache Spark (aka #SparkNotes)!

I'm https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski[Jacek Laskowski], an *independent consultant* who offers development and training services for *Apache Spark* (and Scala, sbt with a bit of Hadoop YARN, Apache Kafka, Apache Hive, Apache Mesos, Akka Actors/Stream/HTTP, and Docker). I lead http://www.meetup.com/WarsawScala/[Warsaw Scala Enthusiasts] and http://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Spark[Warsaw Spark] meetups.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl or https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to discuss Spark opportunities, e.g. courses, workshops, or other mentoring or development services.

If you like the notes you may consider participating in my own, very hands-on https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop#spark-and-scala-workshop[Spark and Scala Workshop].

This collections of notes (what some may rashly call a "book") serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]. The notes aim to help me designing and developing better products with Spark. It is also a viable proof of my understanding of Apache Spark. I do eventually want to reach the highest level of mastery in Apache Spark.

It _may_ become a book one day, but surely serves as *the study material* for trainings, workshops, videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to know it early. You will also learn about the upcoming events about Apache Spark.

Expect text and code snippets from http://spark.apache.org/community.html[Spark's mailing lists], http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/[the official documentation of Apache Spark], http://stackoverflow.com/tags/apache-spark/info[StackOverflow], blog posts, http://search.oreilly.com/?q=learning+spark[books from O'Reilly], press releases, YouTube/Vimeo videos, http://www.quora.com/Apache-Spark[Quora], https://github.com/apache/spark[the source code of Apache Spark], etc. Attribution follows.

== GitHub Flavored writing flow

=== AsciiDoc

For the first time I'm using http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc] to write a doc that is ultimately supposed to become the book about Apache Spark.

=== GitHub for pull requests and tasks

While on writing route, I'm also aiming at mastering the git(hub) flow to write the book as described in https://medium.com/@chacon/living-the-future-of-technical-writing-2f368bd0a272[Living the Future of Technical Writing] (with pull requests for chapters, action items to show progress of each branch and such).

The branching and task progress features embrace the concept of working on a branch per chapter and using pull requests with https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Flavored Markdown] for Task Lists. Once the tasks are defined, GitHub shows progress of a pull request with number of tasks completed and progress bar.

=== Atom editor
I couldn't be me if I didn't use https://atom.io/[Atom editor] with https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc preview] installed.

It's all to make things harder..._ekhm_...reach higher levels of writing zen.
