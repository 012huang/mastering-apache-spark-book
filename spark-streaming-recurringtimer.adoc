== RecurringTimer

CAUTION: FIXME

`RecurringTimer` uses a daemon thread prefixed `RecurringTimer - [name]` that executes `callback` every batch duration. The sleeping is achieved by `Clock.waitTillTime`.

When it starts (as part of JobGenerator start), you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO RecurringTimer: Started timer for JobGenerator at time [nextTime]
```
