== Structured Streaming (aka Continuous Queries)

TIP: Watch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8360[SPARK-8360 Streaming DataFrames] to track progress of the feature that is slated for Spark 2.0.0.

NOTE: The feature is also called *Streaming Spark SQL Query* or *Streaming DataFrames* or *Continuous DataFrames*.

*Structured Streaming* is a high-level streaming API atop Spark SQL. It offers primitives like *event time*, *windowing*, *sessions*, *sources* and *sinks*.

The aim is to unify streaming, interactive and batch queries.
