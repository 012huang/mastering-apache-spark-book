== Spark Streaming

Spark Streaming runs a collection of SparkStreaming jobs in batches.

=== [[JobScheduler]] JobScheduler

`JobScheduler` schedules jobs to be run on Spark. It is created as part of creating a <<creating-instance, StreamingContext>> and starts with it.

It uses <<RecurringTimer, RecurringTimer>> (as `timer` with name being `JobGenerator`) to post `GenerateJobs` events on `eventLoop`.

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobScheduler` logger to see what happens in JobScheduler.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobScheduler=DEBUG
```
====

With DEBUG logging level you should see the following message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Starting JobScheduler
```

When `JobScheduler` starts, it starts <<JobScheduler-eventLoop, eventLoop - JobSchedulerEvent Handler>> and <<ReceiverTracker, ReceiverTracker>>. It also starts the <<JobGenerator, JobGenerator>>.

At the end, it prints the following INFO message to the logs:

```
INFO JobScheduler: Started JobScheduler
```

==== [[JobScheduler-eventLoop]] eventLoop - JobSchedulerEvent Handler

JobScheduler uses `EventLoop` for JobSchedulerEvent events. It accepts <<JobStarted,JobStarted>> and <<JobCompleted, JobCompleted>> events. It also processes `ErrorReported` events.

===== [[JobStarted]] JobStarted and handleJobStart

CAUTION: FIXME

===== [[JobCompleted]] JobCompleted and handleJobCompletion

CAUTION: FIXME

==== [[RecurringTimer]] RecurringTimer

CAUTION: FIXME

`RecurringTimer` uses a daemon thread prefixed `RecurringTimer - [name]` that executes `callback` every batch duration. The sleeping is achieved by `Clock.waitTillTime`.

==== [[StreamingListenerBus]] StreamingListenerBus

CAUTION: FIXME

==== [[StreamingJobProgressListener]] StreamingJobProgressListener

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[ReceiverTracker]] ReceiverTracker

CAUTION: FIXME

`ReceiverTracker` manages the execution of the receivers of ReceiverInputDStreams.

If there is at least one `ReceiverInputDStreams` the RPC endpoint `ReceiverTracker` using <<ReceiverTrackerEndpoint, ReceiverTrackerEndpoint>> is set up.

When `ReceiverTracker` starts, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO ReceiverTracker: Starting [receivers.length] receivers
```

It posts `StartAllReceivers` to `ReceiverTracker` RPC endpoint.

You should then see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO ReceiverTracker: ReceiverTracker started
```

==== [[ReceiverTrackerEndpoint]] ReceiverTrackerEndpoint

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[JobGenerator]] JobGenerator

CAUTION: FIXME

When `JobGenerator` starts, it starts <<JobGenerator-eventLoop, eventLoop - JobGeneratorEvent Handler>>.

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator` logger to see what happens in JobGenerator.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator=DEBUG
```
====

For every `JobGeneratorEvent` event, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Got event [event]
```

You should see the following INFO message in the logs when it starts:

```
INFO JobGenerator: Started JobGenerator at [startTime] ms
```

==== [[JobGenerator-eventLoop]] eventLoop - JobGeneratorEvent Handler

JobGenerator uses `EventLoop` for JobGeneratorEvent events.

See below for extensive coverage of event types it handles.

===== [[GenerateJobs]] GenerateJobs and generateJobs

CAUTION: FIXME

===== [[ClearMetadata]] ClearMetadata and clearMetadata

CAUTION: FIXME

===== [[DoCheckpoint]] DoCheckpoint and doCheckpoint

CAUTION: FIXME

===== [[ClearCheckpointData]] ClearCheckpointData and clearCheckpointData

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[RateController]] RateController

CAUTION: FIXME

InputDStreams can define a `RateController` that is registered to JobScheduler's `listenerBus`  (using `ssc.addStreamingListener`) when JobScheduler starts.

=== [[StreamingTab]] StreamingTab

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[StreamingContext]] StreamingContext

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[JobHandler]] JobHandler

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[DStreamGraph]] DStreamGraph

CAUTION: FIXME

It knows about `inputStreams` and `outputStreams`.

=== [[internal-registries]] Internal Registries

* `nextInputStreamId` - the current InputStream id

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating Instance

When you create a new instance of `StreamingContext` (and you will eventually) it first checks whether a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext] or the checkpoint directory are given.

[TIP]
====
StreamingContext will warn you when you use `local` or `local[1]` link:spark-deployment-environments.adoc#master-urls[master URLs]:

```
WARN StreamingContext: spark.master should be set as local[n], n > 1 in local mode if you have receivers to get data, otherwise Spark jobs will not get resources to process the received data.
```
====

A <<DStreamGraph, DStreamGraph>> is created.

A <<JobScheduler, JobScheduler>> is created.

A <<StreamingJobProgressListener, StreamingJobProgressListener>> is created.

The <<StreamingTab, Streaming tab>> in web UI is created (when spark.ui.enabled is set).

A <<StreamingSource, StreamingSource>> is instantiated.

At this point, it is assumed that the StreamingContext is `INITIALIZED`.

=== [[StreamingSource]] StreamingSource

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.streaming.concurrentJobs` (default: `1`) is the number of concurrent jobs, i.e. threads in streaming-job-executor thread pool to run collections of <<JobHandler, JobHandler>>.

* `spark.streaming.clock` (default: `org.apache.spark.util.SystemClock`) specifies a fully-qualified class name that extends `org.apache.spark.util.Clock` to mock time.

* `spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches` (default: `1000`)

* `spark.streaming.checkpoint.directory`
