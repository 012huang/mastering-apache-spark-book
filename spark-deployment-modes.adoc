== Deployment Modes

Spark Deployment modes:

* link:spark-local.adoc[local]
* link:spark-cluster.adoc[cluster]
** link:spark-standalone.adoc[Spark Standalone]
** link:spark-mesos.adoc[Spark on Mesos]
** link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN]

=== [[master-urls]] Master URLs

Spark supports the following *master URLs* (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L2729-L2742[private object SparkMasterRegex]):

* *local*, *local[N]* and *local[{asterisk}]* for link:spark-local.adoc[Spark local]
* *local[N, maxRetries]* for link:spark-local.adoc[Spark local-with-retries]
* *local-cluster[N, cores, memory]* for simulating a Spark cluster of [N, cores, memory] locally
* *spark://host:port,host1:port1,...* for connecting to link:spark-standalone.adoc[Spark Standalone cluster(s)]
* *mesos://* or *zk://* for link:spark-mesos.adoc[Spark on Mesos cluster]
* *yarn-cluster* (deprecated: *yarn-standalone*) for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN (cluster mode)]
* *yarn-client* for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN cluster (client mode)]
* *simr://* for Simr cluster

You use a master URL with link:spark-submit.adoc[spark-submit for `--master` command-line option] or <<creating-sparkcontext, when creating SparkContext with `setMaster` method>>.
