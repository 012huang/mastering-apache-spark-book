== [[InputAdapter]] InputAdapter Unary Physical Operator

`InputAdapter` is a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#UnaryExecNode[unary physical operator] (with link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc[CodegenSupport]) that is an adapter to generate code for the single child operator that consumes an RDD iterator of link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[InternalRow].

`InputAdapter` is created when...FIXME

`InputAdapter` removes the star when generating a stringified tree representation (that link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-WholeStageCodegenExec.adoc[WholeStageCodegenExec] adds), e.g. for link:spark-sql-dataset-operators.adoc#explain[explain] operator.
