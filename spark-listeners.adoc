== Listeners (for events from Spark's Scheduler)

A Spark *listener* is a class that extends `SparkListener` to listen to events from the Spark scheduler. It can receive events about:

* when a stage completes successfully or fails
* when a stage is submitted
* when a task starts
* when a task begins remotely fetching its result
* when a task ends
* when a job starts
* when a job ends
* when environment properties have been updated
* when a new block manager has joined
* when an existing block manager has been removed
* when an RDD is manually unpersisted by the application
* when the application starts
* when the application ends
* when the driver receives task metrics from an executor in a heartbeat.
* when the driver registers a new executor.
* when the driver removes an executor.
* when the driver receives a block update info.

`spark.extraListeners` is a comma-separated list of class names that extend `SparkListener`. It's assumed that the classes come with one of the following (in this order):

* a single-argument constructor that accepts `SparkConf`
* a zero-argument constructor

Set `INFO` for `org.apache.spark.SparkContext` logger to see the extra listeners being registered.

Internal listeners:

* web UI and event logging listeners
