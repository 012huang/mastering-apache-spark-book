== [[AggregateExpression]] AggregateExpression -- Unevaluable Expression for AggregateFunction

`AggregateExpression` is an link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc#Unevaluable[unevaluable expression] (i.e. with no support for `eval` and `doGenCode` methods) that holds the following:

* [[aggregateFunction]] link:spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.adoc[AggregateFunction]
* [[mode]] `AggregateMode`
* [[isDistinct]] `isDistinct` flag indicating whether this aggregation is distinct or not (e.g. whether SQL's `DISTINCT` keyword was used for the <<aggregateFunction, aggregate function>>)
* [[resultId]] `ExprId`

[NOTE]
====
`AggregateExpression` is a mere container for an <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> and relays all calls to it directly.

`AggregateFunction` is used wrapped inside a `AggregateExpression` using link:spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.adoc#toAggregateExpression[toAggregateExpression] method.

| `nullable`
| Whether or not <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> expression is nullable.

| [[references]] `references`
a| `AttributeSet` with the following:

* `references` of <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> when <<mode, AggregateMode>> is `Partial` or `Complete`

* link:spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.adoc#aggBufferAttributes[aggBufferAttributes] of <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> when `PartialMerge` or `Final`

* `AttributeReference` when <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> is itself resolved

* `UnresolvedAttribute` otherwise

| `sql`
| Requests <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> to generate SQL output (with <<isDistinct, isDistinct>> flag).

| `toString`
| <<toString-prefixes, Prefix per AggregateMode>> followed by <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>>'s `toAggString` (with <<isDistinct, isDistinct>> flag).
