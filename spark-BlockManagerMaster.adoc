== BlockManagerMaster - BlockManager for Driver

`BlockManagerMaster` is the link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager] that runs on the link:spark-driver.adoc[driver].

It is available as <<BlockManagerMasterEndpoint, BlockManagerMaster RPC endpoint>>.

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` logging level for `org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerMaster` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerMaster=INFO
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[stop]] Stopping BlockManagerMaster (stop method)

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

`stop` sends `StopBlockManagerMaster` to <<BlockManagerMasterEndpoint, BlockManagerMaster RPC endpoint>> and waits for a response.

If all went fine, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO BlockManagerMaster: BlockManagerMaster stopped
```

Otherwise, a `SparkException` is thrown.

```
BlockManagerMasterEndpoint returned false, expected true.
```
