== [[TaskScheduler]] TaskScheduler -- Spark Scheduler

`TaskScheduler` is responsible for <<submitTasks, submitting tasks for execution>> in a Spark application] (according to <<schedulingMode, scheduling policy>>).

.TaskScheduler works for a single SparkContext
image::images/sparkstandalone-sparkcontext-taskscheduler-schedulerbackend.png[align="center"]

`TaskScheduler` tracks available executors

`TaskScheduler` is given sets of tasks for execution (as link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSets]) from link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] for each stage, and is responsible for scheduling the tasks to the cluster, running them, retrying if there are failures, and mitigating stragglers.

Spark comes with the following custom `TaskSchedulers`:

* link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc[TaskSchedulerImpl]

* link:yarn/spark-yarn-yarnscheduler.adoc[YarnScheduler] for link:yarn/README.adoc[Spark on YARN] in link:spark-submit.adoc#deploy-mode[client deploy mode].

* link:yarn/spark-yarn-yarnclusterscheduler.adoc[YarnClusterScheduler] for link:yarn/README.adoc[Spark on YARN] in link:spark-submit.adoc#deploy-mode[cluster deploy mode].

NOTE: The source of `TaskScheduler` is available as https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskScheduler.scala[org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskScheduler].

|===
| Method
| Description

| <<applicationAttemptId, applicationAttemptId>>
|

| <<applicationId, applicationId>>
|

| <<cancelTasks, cancelTasks>>
|

| [[defaultParallelism]] defaultParallelism
| Calculating the default level of parallelism

Used when `SparkContext` link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#defaultParallelism[is requested for the default level of parallelism].

| [[executorHeartbeatReceived]] executorHeartbeatReceived
| Handler of heartbeats from executors. Receives task metrics (as a set of link:spark-accumulators.adoc[accumulators]) for in-progress tasks.

Expected to return `true` when the executor `execId` is managed by the `TaskScheduler`. `false` is to indicate that the link:spark-Executor.adoc#reportHeartBeat[block manager (on the executor) should re-register].

Used exclusively when `HeartbeatReceiver` RPC endpoint link:spark-sparkcontext-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#Heartbeat[receives a heartbeat from an executor].

| <<executorLost, executorLost>>
|

| <<postStartHook, postStartHook>>
| Post-start initialization

Does nothing by default, but allows custom implementations for some additional post-start initialization.

Used exclusively when `SparkContext` link:spark-sparkcontext-creating-instance-internals.adoc#postStartHook[is created] (right before `SparkContext` is considered fully initialized).

| [[rootPool]] rootPool
| link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[Pool] (of link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulables]).

| [[schedulingMode]] schedulingMode
| Puts tasks in order according to a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[scheduling policy] (as `schedulingMode`). It is used in link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#getSchedulingMode[SparkContext.getSchedulingMode].

| <<setDAGScheduler, setDAGScheduler>>
| Assigns link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler]

Used exclusively when `DAGScheduler` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#creating-instance[is created] (and passes on a reference to itself).

| [[start]] start
| Starts `TaskScheduler`.

Used exclusively when `SparkContext` link:spark-sparkcontext-creating-instance-internals.adoc#taskScheduler-start[is created].

| [[stop]] stop
| Stops `TaskScheduler`

Used exclusively when `DAGScheduler` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#stop[is stopped].

| [[submitTasks]] submitTasks
| Submits tasks for execution (from link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] for link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc[Stage])

Used exclusively when `DAGScheduler` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#submitMissingTasks[submits tasks (of a stage) for execution].
|===

=== [[lifecycle]] TaskScheduler's Lifecycle

A `TaskScheduler` is created while link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext is being created] (by calling link:spark-sparkcontext-creating-instance-internals.adoc#createTaskScheduler[SparkContext.createTaskScheduler] for a given link:spark-deployment-environments.adoc[master URL] and link:spark-submit.adoc#deploy-mode[deploy mode]).

.TaskScheduler uses SchedulerBackend to support different clusters
image::diagrams/taskscheduler-uses-schedulerbackend.png[align="center"]

At this point in SparkContext's lifecycle, the internal `_taskScheduler` points at the `TaskScheduler` (and it is "announced" by sending a blocking link:spark-sparkcontext-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#TaskSchedulerIsSet[`TaskSchedulerIsSet` message to HeartbeatReceiver RPC endpoint]).

The <<start, TaskScheduler is started>> right after the blocking `TaskSchedulerIsSet` message receives a response.

The <<applicationId, application ID>> and the <<applicationAttemptId, application's attempt ID>> are set at this point (and `SparkContext` uses the application id to set link:spark-configuration.adoc#spark.app.id[spark.app.id] Spark property, and configure link:spark-webui-SparkUI.adoc[SparkUI], and link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager]).

CAUTION: FIXME The application id is described as "associated with the job." in TaskScheduler, but I think it is "associated with the application" and you can have many jobs per application.

Right before SparkContext is fully initialized, <<postStartHook, TaskScheduler.postStartHook>> is called.

The internal `_taskScheduler` is cleared (i.e. set to `null`) while link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#stop[SparkContext is being stopped].

<<stop, TaskScheduler is stopped>> while link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#stop[DAGScheduler is being stopped].

WARNING: FIXME If it is SparkContext to start a TaskScheduler, shouldn't SparkContext stop it too? Why is this the way it is now?

=== [[applicationId]] Finding Unique Identifier of Spark Application -- `applicationId` Method

[source, scala]
----
applicationId(): String
----

`applicationId` finds the unique identifier of a Spark application.

`applicationId` is in the format `spark-application-[System.currentTimeMillis]` by default and is expected to be overriden by custom `TaskSchedulers` (e.g. link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#applicationId[TaskSchedulerImpl]).

NOTE: `applicationId` is used exclusively when `SparkContext` link:spark-sparkcontext-creating-instance-internals.adoc#_applicationId[is initialized] (to set link:spark-configuration.adoc#spark.app.id[spark.app.id]).

=== [[applicationAttemptId]] Calculating Application Attempt ID -- `applicationAttemptId` Method

[source, scala]
----
applicationAttemptId(): Option[String]
----

`applicationAttemptId` gives the current application's attempt id.

NOTE: It is currently used in link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext while it is being initialized].

=== [[executorLost]] Handling Executor Lost Events -- `executorLost` Method

[source, scala]
----
executorLost(executorId: String, reason: ExecutorLossReason): Unit
----

`executorLost` handles events about an executor `executorId` being lost for a given `reason`.

NOTE: It is currently used in link:spark-sparkcontext-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc[HeartbeatReceiver RPC endpoint in SparkContext to process host expiration events] and to remove executors in scheduler backends.
