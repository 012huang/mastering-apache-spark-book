== StateDStream

`StateDStream` is the specialized link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc[DStream] that is the result of link:spark-streaming-operators-stateful.adoc#updateStateByKey[updateStateByKey] stateful operator. It is a wrapper around a `parent` key-value pair dstream to build stateful computation (using `updateStateByKey` operator) and as a stateful dstream it forces link:spark-streaming-checkpointing.adoc[checkpointing] (and hence some additional setup).

It uses a `parent` key-value pair dstream, <<updateFunc, updateFunc>> update state function, a `partitioner`, a flag whether or not to `preservePartitioning` and an optional key-value pair `initialRDD`.

It works with link:spark-rdd-caching.adoc#StorageLevel[MEMORY_ONLY_SER] storage level enabled.

The only link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#contract[dependency] of `StateDStream` is the input `parent` key-value pair dstream.

The link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#contract[slide duration] is exactly the same as that in `parent`.

It forces link:spark-streaming-checkpointing.adoc[checkpointing] regardless of the current dstream configuration, i.e. the internal link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#checkpointing[mustCheckpoint] is enabled.

When requested to link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#contract[compute a RDD] it first attempts to get the *state RDD* for the previous batch (using link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#getOrCompute[DStream.getOrCompute]). If there is one, `parent` stream is requested for a RDD for the current batch (using link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#getOrCompute[DStream.getOrCompute]). If `parent` has computed one,  <<computeUsingPreviousRDD, computeUsingPreviousRDD(parentRDD, prevStateRDD)>> is called.

If however `parent` has not generated a RDD for the current batch but the state RDD existed, `updateFn` is called for every key of the state RDD to generate a new state per partition (using link:spark-rdd-operators-mapPartitions.adoc[RDD.mapPartitions])

NOTE: No input data for already-running input stream triggers (re)computation of the state RDD (per partition).

If the state RDD has been found, which means that this is the first input data batch, `parent` stream is requested to link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#getOrCompute[getOrCompute] the RDD for the current batch.

Otherwise, when no state RDD exists, `parent` stream is requested for a RDD for the current batch (using link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#getOrCompute[DStream.getOrCompute]) and when no RDD was generated for the batch, no computation is triggered.

NOTE: When the stream processing starts, i.e. no state RDD exists, and there is no input data received, no computation is triggered.

Given no state RDD and with `parent` RDD computed, when `initialRDD` is `NONE`, the input data batch (as `parent` RDD) is grouped by key (using link:spark-rdd-partitions.adoc#PairRDDFunctions[groupByKey] with `partitioner`) and then the update state function `updateFunc` is applied to the partitioned input data (using link:spark-rdd-operators-mapPartitions.adoc[mapPartitions]) with `None` state. Otherwise, <<computeUsingPreviousRDD, computeUsingPreviousRDD(parentRDD, initialStateRDD)>> is called.

=== [[updateFunc]] updateFunc - State Update Function

The signature of `updateFunc` is as follows:

[source, scala]
----
updateFunc: (Iterator[(K, Seq[V], Option[S])]) => Iterator[(K, S)]
----

It should be read as given a collection of triples of a key, new records for the key, and the current state for the key, generate a collection of keys and their state.

=== [[computeUsingPreviousRDD]] computeUsingPreviousRDD

[source, scala]
----
computeUsingPreviousRDD(parentRDD: RDD[(K, V)], prevStateRDD: RDD[(K, S)]): Option[RDD[(K, S)]]
----

The `computeUsingPreviousRDD` method uses `cogroup` and `mapPartitions` to build the optional final state RDD.

[NOTE]
====
The signature of `cogroup` is as follows and applies to key-value pair RDDs, i.e. `RDD[(K, V)]`.

[source, scala]
----
cogroup[W](other: RDD[(K, W)], partitioner: Partitioner): RDD[(K, (Iterable[V], Iterable[W]))]
----
====

It first performs `cogroup` of `parentRDD` and `prevStateRDD` using the constructor's `partitioner`.

It defines an internal update function that takes the first element from the state's iterator of elements for a key (if exists) and builds a triple of the key, a collection of the input records for the key, and the optional state for the key. With the triple, the internal update function calls the constructor's <<updateFunc, updateFunc>>.

The state RDD becomes the cogrouped RDD with elements `mapPartitions` with the internal update function and the constructor's `preservePartitioning`.
