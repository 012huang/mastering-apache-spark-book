== Cluster Deploy Mode and YarnClusterSchedulerBackend

Spark on YARN supports submitting Spark applications in link:spark-submit.adoc#deploy-mode[cluster deploy mode].

In cluster deploy mode Spark on YARN uses <<YarnClusterSchedulerBackend, YarnClusterSchedulerBackend>>.

=== [[YarnClusterSchedulerBackend]] YarnClusterSchedulerBackend

`YarnClusterSchedulerBackend` is a link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[scheduler backend] for Spark on YARN in <<cluster-mode, cluster deploy mode>>.

This is the only scheduler backend that supports <<multiple-application-attempts, multiple application attempts>> and link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#getDriverLogUrls[URLs for driver's logs] to display as links in the web UI in the Executors tab for the driver.

It uses `spark.yarn.app.attemptId` under the covers (that the YARN resource manager sets?).
