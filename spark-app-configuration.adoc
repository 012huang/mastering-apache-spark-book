== Configuring Spark Applications

TODO

* Describe `SparkConfig` object for the application configuration.
* the default configs
* system properties

* Spark Properties - use link:spark-webui.adoc[Web UI] to learn the current properties.
*

=== Spark Properties

Every user program starts with instantiating `SparkConf` that holds master, appName and other properties required for proper runs. It is then used to create link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext].
