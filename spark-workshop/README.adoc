== Spark Advanced Workshop

Taking the notes and leading http://www.meetup.com/WarsawScala/[Scala/Spark meetups in Warsaw, Poland] gave me opportunity to create the initial version of the *Spark Advanced workshop*. It is a highly-interactive in-depth 2-day workshop about Spark with many practical exercises.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl to discuss having one at your convenient location and/or straight in the office. We could also host the workshop remotely.

It's is a hands-on workshop with lots of exercises and do-fail-fix-rinse-repeat cycles.
