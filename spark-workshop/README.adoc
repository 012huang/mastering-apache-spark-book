== Spark Advanced Workshop

Taking the notes and running Scala/Spark meetups in Warsaw, Poland gave me opportunity to create the draft of a *Spark Advanced workshop*. It is a highly-interactive in-depth 2-day workshop about Spark with many practical exercises.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl to discuss having one at your convenient location and/or straight in the office.

It's going to be a hands-on workshop with lots of exercises and do-fail-fix-rinse-repeat cycles.
