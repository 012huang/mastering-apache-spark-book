== Encoder

CAUTION: FIXME

`Encoder` works with the type of the accompanying link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc[Dataset].

An `Encoder` object is used to convert your domain object (a JVM object) into Spark's internal representation. It allows for significantly faster serialization and deserialization (comparing to the default Java serializer).

NOTE: Encoders are part of link:spark-sql-catalyst.adoc[Catalyst Optimizer].

NOTE: link:spark-sql-sqlcontext.adoc#implicits[SQLContext.implicits] object comes with Encoders for many types in Scala.

Encoders map columns (of your dataset) to fields (of your JVM object) by name. It is by Encoders that you can bridge JVM objects to data sources (CSV, JDBC, Parquet, Avro, JSON, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, memsql) and vice versa.
