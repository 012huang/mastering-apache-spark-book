== Checkpointing

There are two types of checkpointing:

* In Spark - RDD checkpointing which saves the actual intermediate RDD data
* In Spark Streaming - DStream checkpoints which saves the DAG of DStreams, that is, only metadata

FIXME How it works, what is checkpointed, and at what frequency?

FIXME Which one is for _Offset checkpoints (partition, offset) when using kafka direct streaming approach_?

* checkpointing to HDFS
