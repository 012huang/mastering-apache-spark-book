== [[SparkPlan]] Spark Plan

`SparkPlan` is an abstract link:spark-sql-query-plan.adoc[QueryPlan].

It has the following attributes:

* `metadata`
* `metrics`
* `outputPartitioning`
* `outputOrdering`

`SparkPlan` can be executed (using the final `execute` method) to compute `RDD[InternalRow]`.

`SparkPlan` comes with the following `final` methods that prepare environment and pass calls on to corresponding methods from <<contract, SparkPlan Contract>>:

* `execute` that calls `doExecute`
* `prepare` that calls `doPrepare`
* `executeBroadcast` that calls `doExecuteBroadcast`

=== [[contract]] SparkPlan Contract

The contract of `SparkPlan` requires that concrete implementations define the following method:

* `doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow]`

They may also define their own custom overrides:

* `doPrepare`
* `doExecuteBroadcast`

CAUTION: FIXME Why are there two executes?
