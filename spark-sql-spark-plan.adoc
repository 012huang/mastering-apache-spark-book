== [[SparkPlan]] SparkPlan -- Physical Execution Plan

`SparkPlan` is the base link:spark-sql-query-plan.adoc[QueryPlan] for physical operators that, when executed, produce link:spark-rdd.adoc[RDDs] of link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[InternalRow], i.e. ``RDD[InternalRow]``s.

CAUTION: FIXME `SparkPlan` is `Serializable`. Why?

NOTE: The naming convention for physical operators in Spark's source code is to have their names end with the _Exec_ prefix, e.g. `DebugExec` or <<LocalTableScanExec, LocalTableScanExec>>.

TIP: Read link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[InternalRow] about the internal binary row format.

`SparkPlan` has the following attributes:

* `metadata`
* <<metrics, metrics>>
* `outputPartitioning`
* `outputOrdering`

`SparkPlan` has the following `final` methods that prepare environment and pass calls on to corresponding methods that constitute <<contract, SparkPlan Contract>>:

* `execute` calls `doExecute`
* `prepare` calls `doPrepare`
* `executeBroadcast` calls `doExecuteBroadcast`

=== [[CoalesceExec]] CoalesceExec

`CoalesceExec` is a `UnaryExecNode` with `numPartitions` number of partitions and a `child` spark plan. `CoalesceExec` represents `Repartition` logical plan at execution. When executed, it executes the input `child` and calls link:spark-rdd-partitions.adoc#coalesce[coalesce] on the result RDD (with `shuffle` disabled).

Please note that since physical operators present themselves without the suffix _Exec_, `CoalesceExec` is the `Coalesce` in the Physical Plan section in the following example:

[source, scala]
----
scala> df.rdd.getNumPartitions
res6: Int = 8

scala> df.coalesce(1).rdd.getNumPartitions
res7: Int = 1

scala> df.coalesce(1).explain(extended = true)
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
Repartition 1, false
+- LocalRelation [value#1]

== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
value: int
Repartition 1, false
+- LocalRelation [value#1]

== Optimized Logical Plan ==
Repartition 1, false
+- LocalRelation [value#1]

== Physical Plan ==
Coalesce 1
+- LocalTableScan [value#1]
----

`output` collection of `Attribute` matches the ``child``'s (since `CoalesceExec` is about changing the number of partitions not the internal representation).

`outputPartitioning` returns a `SinglePartition` when the input `numPartitions` is `1` while a `UnknownPartitioning` for the other cases.

=== [[LocalTableScanExec]] LocalTableScanExec

`LocalTableScanExec` is a leaf `SparkPlan` node with no `children` and `producedAttributes` being `outputSet`.

`LocalTableScanExec` is a result of applying `BasicOperators` strategy to link:spark-sql-logical-plan.adoc#LocalRelation[LocalRelation] and `MemoryPlan` link:spark-sql-logical-plan.adoc[logical plans].

[source, scala]
----
scala> Seq(1).toDS.explain(extended = true)
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
LocalRelation [value#1]

== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
value: int
LocalRelation [value#1]

== Optimized Logical Plan ==
LocalRelation [value#1]

== Physical Plan ==
LocalTableScan [value#1]

When executed (as `doExecute`), `LocalTableScanExec` link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#parallelize[creates an `RDD` of ``InternalRow``s].

=== [[contract]] SparkPlan Contract

The contract of `SparkPlan` requires that concrete implementations define the following method:

* `doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow]`

They may also define their own custom overrides:

* `doPrepare`
* `doExecuteBroadcast`

CAUTION: FIXME Why are there two executes?

=== [[executeCollect]] executeCollect

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[SQLMetric]] SQLMetric

`SQLMetric` is an link:spark-accumulators.adoc[accumulator] that accumulate and produce long values.

There are three known `SQLMetrics`:

* `sum`
* `size`
* `timing`

=== [[metrics]] metrics Lookup Table

[source, scala]
----
metrics: Map[String, SQLMetric] = Map.empty
----

`metrics` is a `private[sql]` lookup table of supported <<SQLMetric, SQLMetrics>> by their names.
