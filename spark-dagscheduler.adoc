== DAGScheduler

[NOTE]
====
The introduction that follows was highly influenced by the scaladoc of https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala[org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler]. As DAGScheduler is a private class it does not appear in the official API documentation. You are strongly encouraged to read https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala[the sources] and read this and the related pages afterwards.

_"Reading the sources"_, I say?! Yes, I _am_ kidding!

=== Introduction

*DAGScheduler* is the scheduling layer in Apache Spark that implements *stage-oriented scheduling*, i.e. RDD actions submit jobs that ultimately become stages with parallel tasks (see link:spark-execution-model.adoc[Execution Model]).

.Executing action leads to new ResultStage and ActiveJob in DAGScheduler
image::images/dagscheduler-rdd-partitions-job-resultstage.png[align="center"]

The fundamental concepts of DAGScheduler are *jobs* and *stages* (refer to link:spark-dagscheduler-jobs.adoc[Jobs] and link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc[Stages] respectively).

DAGScheduler works on a driver. It is created as part of link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#initialization[SparkContext's initialization], right after link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler] and link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[SchedulerBackend] are ready.

DAGScheduler does three things in Spark (thorough explanations follow):

* It computes an *execution DAG*, i.e. DAG of stages, for a job.
* It determines the <<preferred-locations, preferred locations>> to run each task on.
* It handles failures due to *shuffle output files* being lost.

It computes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[a directed acyclic graph (DAG)] of stages for each job, keeps track of which RDDs and stage outputs are materialized, and finds a minimal schedule to run jobs. It then submits stages to link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler] that spawns tasks to compute results (link:spark-local.adoc[locally] or link:spark-cluster.adoc[on cluster]).

In addition to coming up with the execution DAG, DAGScheduler also determines the preferred locations to run each task on, based on the current cache status, and passes the information to link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler].

Furthermore, it handles failures due to shuffle output files being lost, in which case old stages may need to be resubmitted. Failures within a stage that are not caused by shuffle file loss are handled by the TaskScheduler itself, which will retry each task a small number of times before cancelling the whole stage.

DAGScheduler uses an *event queue architecture* in which a thread can post `DAGSchedulerEvent` events, e.g. a new job or stage being submitted, that DAGScheduler reads and executes sequentially. See the section <<event-loop, Internal Event Loop - dag-scheduler-event-loop>>.

DAGScheduler runs stages in topological order.

DAGScheduler maintains different sets of stages in per execution state:

* waiting (`waitingStages`)
* running (`runningStages`)
* failed (`failedStages`)

DAGScheduler keeps track of the number of jobs already submitted (using `nextJobId` internal field and `numTotalJobs` method) as well as the number of stages (using `nextStageId`).

[TIP]
====
Turn `DEBUG` or more detailed `TRACE` logging to see what happens inside `DAGScheduler`.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties` with requested log level - `DEBUG` or `TRACE`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler=TRACE
```
====

DAGScheduler needs link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext], link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[Task Scheduler], link:spark-scheduler-listeners.adoc[Listener Bus], link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc[MapOutputTracker] and link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager] to work. However, at the very minimum, DAGScheduler needs SparkContext only (and asks SparkContext for the other services).

DAGScheduler reports metrics about its execution (refer to the section <<metrics, Metrics>>).

DAGScheduler keeps track of the following information:

* a mapping between jobs to their stages (using `jobIdToStageIds`)
* a mapping between stage ids to stage instances (using `stageIdToStage`)
* a mapping between ids to ShuffleMapStages (using `shuffleToMapStage`) - FIXME
* a mapping between job ids to ActiveJob instances (using `jobIdToActiveJob`)
* a set of ActiveJob instances (`activeJobs`)
* a mapping between RDD ids and their cache preferences (`cacheLocs`)

When DAGScheduler schedules a job as a result of link:spark-rdd.adoc#actions[executing an action on a RDD] or link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#running-jobs[calling SparkContext.runJob() method directly], it spawns parallel tasks to compute (partial) results per partition.

The number of partition in a job depends on the type of a stage - <<ResultStage, ResultStage>> or <<ShuffleMapStage, ShuffleMapStage>>.

A job starts with a single target RDD, but can ultimately include other RDDs that are all part of link:spark-rdd#lineage[the target RDD's lineage graph].

=== [[runJob]] DAGScheduler.runJob

When executed, `DAGScheduler.runJob` is given the following arguments:

* A *RDD* to run job on.
* A *function* to run on each partition of the RDD.
* A set of *partitions* to run on (not all partitions are always required to compute a job for actions like `first()` or `take()`).
* A callback *function* `resultHandler` to pass results of executing the function to.
* *Properties* to attach to a job.

It calls <<submitJob, DAGScheduler.submitJob>> and then waits until a result comes using a <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> object. A job can succeed or fail.

When a job succeeds, the following INFO shows up in the logs:

```
INFO Job [jobId] finished: [callSite], took [time] s
```

When a job fails, the following INFO shows up in the logs:

```
INFO Job [jobId] failed: [callSite], took [time] s
```

The method finishes by throwing an exception.

=== [[submitJob]] DAGScheduler.submitJob

`DAGScheduler.submitJob` is called by `SparkContext.submitJob` and <<runJob, DAGScheduler.runJob>>.

When called, it does the following:

* Checks whether the set of partitions to run a function on are in the the range of available partitions of the RDD.
* Increments the internal `nextJobId` job counter.
* Returns a 0-task <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> when no partitions are passed in.
* Or posts <<JobSubmitted, JobSubmitted>> event to <<event-loop, dag-scheduler-event-loop>> and returns a <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>>.

.DAGScheduler.submitJob
image::images/dagscheduler-submitjob.png[align="center"]

You may see an exception thrown when the partitions in the set are outside the range:

```
Attempting to access a non-existent partition: [p]. Total number of partitions: [maxPartitions]
```

=== [[JobListener]] JobListener and Completion Events

You can listen for job completion or failure events after submitting a job to the DAGScheduler using `JobListener`. It is a `private[spark]` contract (a Scala trait) with the following two methods:

[source, scala]
----
private[spark] trait JobListener {
  def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)
  def jobFailed(exception: Exception)
}
----

A job listener is notified each time a task succeeds (by `def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)`), as well as if the whole job fails (by `def jobFailed(exception: Exception)`).

An instance of `JobListener` is used in the following places:

* In `ActiveJob` as a listener to notify if tasks in this job finish or the job fails.
* In `DAGScheduler.handleJobSubmitted`
* In `DAGScheduler.handleMapStageSubmitted`
* In `JobSubmitted`
* In `MapStageSubmitted`

The following are the job listeners used:

* <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> waits until DAGScheduler completes the job and passes the results of tasks to a `resultHandler` function.
* `ApproximateActionListener` FIXME

==== [[JobWaiter]] JobWaiter

A `JobWaiter` is an extension of <<JobListener, JobListener>>. It is used as the return value of <<submitJob, DAGScheduler.submitJob>> and `DAGScheduler.submitMapStage`. You can use a JobWaiter to block until the job finishes executing or to cancel it.

While the methods execute, `JobSubmitted` and `MapStageSubmitted` events are posted that reference the JobWaiter.

Since a `JobWaiter` object is a `JobListener` it gets notifications about `taskSucceeded` and `jobFailed`. When the total number of tasks (that equals the number of partitions to compute) equals the number of `taskSucceeded`, the `JobWaiter` instance is marked succeeded. A `jobFailed` event marks the `JobWaiter` instance failed.

* FIXME Who's using `submitMapStage`?

=== [[event-loop]] dag-scheduler-event-loop - Internal Event Loop

`DAGScheduler.eventProcessLoop` (of type `DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop`) - is the event process loop to which Spark (by <<submitJob, DAGScheduler.submitJob>>) posts jobs to schedule their execution. Later on, link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] talks back to DAGScheduler to inform about the status of the tasks using the same "communication channel".

It allows Spark to release the current thread when posting happens and let the event loop handle events on a separate thread - asynchronously.

...IMAGE...FIXME

Internally, DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop uses https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingDeque.html[java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingDeque] blocking deque that grows indefinitely (i.e. up to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE[Integer.MAX_VALUE] events).

The name of the single "logic" thread that reads events and takes decisions is *dag-scheduler-event-loop*.

```
"dag-scheduler-event-loop" #89 daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 tid=0x00007f809bc0a000 nid=0xc903 waiting on condition [0x0000000125826000]
```

The following are the current types of `DAGSchedulerEvent` events that are handled by `DAGScheduler`:

* <<JobSubmitted, JobSubmitted>> - posted when an action job is submitted to DAGScheduler (via <<submitJob, submitJob>> or `runApproximateJob`).
* <<MapStageSubmitted, MapStageSubmitted>> - posted when a ShuffleMapStage is submitted (via `submitMapStage`).
* <<StageCancelled, StageCancelled>>
* <<JobCancelled, JobCancelled>>
* `JobGroupCancelled`
* `AllJobsCancelled`
* `BeginEvent` - posted when link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] reports that a task is starting.
+
`dagScheduler.handleBeginEvent` is executed in turn.
* `GettingResultEvent` - posted when link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] reports that a task has completed and results are being fetched remotely.
+
`dagScheduler.handleGetTaskResult` executes in turn.
* <<CompletionEvent, CompletionEvent>> - posted when link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] reports that a task has completed successfully or failed.
* `ExecutorAdded` - executor (`execId`) has been spawned on a host (`host`). Remove it from the failed executors list if it was included, and `submitWaitingStages()`.
* `ExecutorLost`
* `TaskSetFailed`
* `ResubmitFailedStages`

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME

* What is an approximate job (as in `DAGScheduler.runApproximateJob`)?
* statistics? `MapOutputStatistics`?
====

==== [[JobCancelled]] JobCancelled and handleJobCancellation

`JobCancelled(jobId: Int)` event is posted to cancel a job if it is scheduled or still running. It triggers execution of `DAGScheduler.handleStageCancellation(stageId)`.

NOTE: It seems that although `SparkContext.cancelJob(jobId: Int)` calls `DAGScheduler.cancelJob`, no feature/code in Spark calls `SparkContext.cancelJob(jobId: Int)`. A dead code?

When <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter.cancel>> is called, it calls `DAGScheduler.cancelJob`. You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Asked to cancel job [jobId]
```

It is a signal to the DAGScheduler to cancel the job.

CAUTION: FIXME

==== [[StageCancelled]] StageCancelled and handleStageCancellation

`StageCancelled(stageId: Int)` event is posted to cancel a stage and all jobs associated with it. It triggers execution of `DAGScheduler.handleStageCancellation(stageId)`.

It is the result of executing `SparkContext.cancelStage(stageId: Int)` that is called from the web UI (controlled by link:spark-webui.adoc#settings[spark.ui.killEnabled]).

CAUTION: FIXME Image of the tab with kill

`DAGScheduler.handleStageCancellation(stageId)` checks whether the `stageId` stage exists and for each job associated with the stage, it calls `handleJobCancellation(jobId, s"because Stage [stageId] was cancelled")`.

NOTE: A stage knows what jobs it is part of using the internal set `jobIds`.

`def handleJobCancellation(jobId: Int, reason: String = "")` checks whether the job exists in `jobIdToStageIds` and if not, prints the following DEBUG to the logs:

```
DEBUG Trying to cancel unregistered job [jobId]
```

However, if the job exists, the job and all the stages that are only used by it (using `failJobAndIndependentStages` method).

For each running stage associated with the job (`jobIdToStageIds`), if there is only one job for the stage (`stageIdToStage`), link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler.cancelTasks] is called, `outputCommitCoordinator.stageEnd(stage.id)`, and `SparkListenerStageCompleted` is posted. The stage is no longer a running one (removed from `runningStages`).

CAUTION: FIXME Image please with the call to TaskScheduler.

* `spark.job.interruptOnCancel` (default: `false`) - controls whether or not to interrupt a job on cancel.

In case link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler.cancelTasks] completed successfully, <<JobListener, JobListener>> is informed about job failure, `cleanupStateForJobAndIndependentStages` is called, and `SparkListenerJobEnd` posted.

CAUTION: FIXME `cleanupStateForJobAndIndependentStages` code review.

CAUTION: FIXME Where are `job.properties` assigned to a job?

```
"Job %d cancelled %s".format(jobId, reason)
```

If no stage exists for `stageId`, the following INFO message shows in the logs:

```
INFO No active jobs to kill for Stage [stageId]
```

At the end, <<submitWaitingStages, DAGScheduler.submitWaitingStages()>> is called.

==== [[MapStageSubmitted]] MapStageSubmitted and handleMapStageSubmitted

When a *MapStageSubmitted* event is posted, it triggers execution of `DAGScheduler.handleMapStageSubmitted` method.

.DAGScheduler.handleMapStageSubmitted handles MapStageSubmitted events
image::diagrams/scheduler-handlemapstagesubmitted.png[align="center"]

It is called with a job id (for a new job to be created), a link:spark-rdd-dependencies.adoc#ShuffleDependency[ShuffleDependency], and a <<JobListener, JobListener>>.

You should see the following INFOs in the logs:

```
Got map stage job %s (%s) with %d output partitions
Final stage: [finalStage] ([finalStage.name])
Parents of final stage: [finalStage.parents]
Missing parents: [list of stages]
```

A SparkListenerJobStart event is posted to `listenerBus` (so other event listeners know about the event - not only DAGScheduler).

The execution procedure of MapStageSubmitted events is then exactly (FIXME ?) as for <<JobSubmitted, JobSubmitted>>.

[TIP]
====
The difference between `handleMapStageSubmitted` and <<JobSubmitted, handleJobSubmitted>>:

* `handleMapStageSubmitted` has `ShuffleDependency` among the input parameters while `handleJobSubmitted` has `finalRDD`, `func`, and `partitions`.
* `handleMapStageSubmitted` initializes `finalStage` as `getShuffleMapStage(dependency, jobId)` while `handleJobSubmitted` as `finalStage = newResultStage(finalRDD, func, partitions, jobId, callSite)`
* `handleMapStageSubmitted` INFO logs `Got map stage job %s (%s) with %d output partitions` with `dependency.rdd.partitions.length` while `handleJobSubmitted` does `Got job %s (%s) with %d output partitions` with `partitions.length`.
* FIXME: Could the above be cut to `ActiveJob.numPartitions`?
* `handleMapStageSubmitted` adds a new job with `finalStage.addActiveJob(job)` while `handleJobSubmitted` sets with `finalStage.setActiveJob(job)`.
* `handleMapStageSubmitted` checks if the final stage has already finished, tells the listener and removes it using the code:
+
[source, scala]
----
if (finalStage.isAvailable) {
  markMapStageJobAsFinished(job, mapOutputTracker.getStatistics(dependency))
}
----
====

==== [[JobSubmitted]] JobSubmitted and handleJobSubmitted

When DAGScheduler receives *JobSubmitted* event it calls `DAGScheduler.handleJobSubmitted` method.

.DAGScheduler.handleJobSubmitted
image::images/dagscheduler-handleJobSubmitted.png[align="center"]

`handleJobSubmitted` has access to the final RDD, the partitions to compute, and the <<JobListener, JobListener>> for the job, i.e. <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>>.

It creates a new <<ResultStage, ResultStage>> (as `finalStage` on the picture) and instantiates `ActiveJob`.

CAUTION: FIXME review `newResultStage`

CAUTION: FIXME `clearCacheLocs` clears an internal field is called in handle* methods. How many instances of DAGScheduler are created and when?

You should see the following INFO messages in the logs:

```
INFO DAGScheduler: Got job [jobId] ([callSite.shortForm]) with [partitions.length] output partitions
INFO DAGScheduler: Final stage: [finalStage] ([finalStage.name])
INFO DAGScheduler: Parents of final stage: [finalStage.parents]
INFO DAGScheduler: Missing parents: [getMissingParentStages(finalStage)]
```

Then, the `finalStage` stage is given the ActiveJob instance and some housekeeping is performed to track the job (using `jobIdToActiveJob` and `activeJobs`).

`SparkListenerJobStart` event is posted to `listenerBus`.

CAUTION: FIXME `jobIdToStageIds` and `stageIdToStage` - they're already computed. When? Where?

When DAGScheduler executes a job it first submits the final stage (using <<stage-submission, submitStage>>).

Right before `handleJobSubmitted` finishes, <<submitWaitingStages, DAGScheduler.submitWaitingStages()>> is called.

==== [[CompletionEvent]] CompletionEvent

CAUTION: FIXME Unfinished

DAGScheduler is told about a task end through `DAGScheduler.handleTaskCompletion` event handler.

FIXME Who's calling the handle and when?

It causes `updateAccumulators` call.

When a task has finished, it triggers  link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] to send a `CompletionEvent` message to DAGScheduler.

FIXME Communication Flow Diagram

Internally, link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] calls `DAGScheduler.taskEnded` to post the `CompletionEvent` event on `eventProcessLoop`.

* `DAGScheduler.onReceive` calls `dagScheduler.handleTaskCompletion(completion)`

=== [[submitWaitingStages]] submitWaitingStages

`DAGScheduler.submitWaitingStages` method checks for waiting or failed stages that could now be eligible for submission.

The following `TRACE` messages show in the logs when the method is called:

```
TRACE DAGScheduler: Checking for newly runnable parent stages
TRACE DAGScheduler: running: [runningStages]
TRACE DAGScheduler: waiting: [waitingStages]
TRACE DAGScheduler: failed: [failedStages]
```

The method clears the internal `waitingStages` set with stages that wait for their parent stages to finish.

It goes over the waiting stages sorted by job ids in increasing order and calls <<stage-submission, submitStage>> method.

=== [[stage-submission]] submitStage - Stage Submission

CAUTION: FIXME

`DAGScheduler.submitStage(stage: Stage)` is called when `stage` is ready for submission.

It recursively submits any missing parents of the stage.

There has to be an ActiveJob instance for the stage to proceed. Otherwise the stage and all the dependent jobs are aborted (using `abortStage`) with the message:

```
Job aborted due to stage failure: No active job for stage [stage.id]
```

For a stage with ActiveJob available, the following DEBUG message show up in the logs:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: submitStage([stage])
```

Only when the stage is not in waiting (`waitingStages`), running (`runningStages`) or failed (`failedStages`) states can this stage be processed.

A list of missing parent stages of the stage is calculated (see <<calculating-missing-parent-stages, Calculating Missing Parent Stages>>) and the following DEBUG message shows up in the logs:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: missing: [missing]
```

When the stage has no parent stages missing, it is submitted and the INFO message shows up in the logs:

```
INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting [stage] ([stage.rdd]), which has no missing parents
```

And <<submitMissingTasks, submitMissingTasks>> is called. That finishes the stage submission.

If however there are missing parent stages for the stage, all stages are processed recursively (using `submitStage`), and the stage is added to `waitingStages` set.

=== [[calculating-missing-parent-stages]] Calculating Missing Parent Stages

CAUTION: FIXME

`DAGScheduler.getMissingParentStages(stage: Stage)` calculates missing parent stages for a given `stage`.

It starts with the target RDD of `stage` given as an input parameter for which `cacheLocs` map is checked by the RDD's id.

The parent stages are actually only the instances of link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc#ShuffleMapStage[ShuffleMapStage].

If the RDD's storage level is `NONE`, it is assumed that no partition cache location are available. Otherwise, the block manager `BlockManagerMaster` is queried with `RDDBlockId` for each partition using `BlockManagerMaster.getLocations`. A collection of `TaskLocation` is built out of it.

If at least one partition of an RDD has been found uncached, the list of dependencies (using `RDD.dependencies`) is traversed to find link:spark-rdd-dependencies.adoc#ShuffleDependency[ShuffleDependency] dependencies for their corresponding link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc#ShuffleMapStage[ShuffleMapStage] (using `getShuffleMapStage`).

CAUTION: FIXME Review `getShuffleMapStage`

CAUTION: FIXME...IMAGE with ShuffleDependencies queried

A missing `ShuffleMapStage` gets added to the set of missing map stages.

=== [[stage-attempts]] Fault recovery - stage attempts

A single stage can be re-executed in multiple *attempts* due to fault recovery. The number of attempts is configured (FIXME).

If `TaskScheduler` reports that a task failed because a map output file from a previous stage was lost, the DAGScheduler resubmits that lost stage. This is detected through a `CompletionEvent` with `FetchFailed`, or an `ExecutorLost` event. `DAGScheduler` will wait a small amount of time to see whether other nodes or tasks fail, then resubmit `TaskSets` for any lost stage(s) that compute the missing tasks.

Please note that tasks from the old attempts of a stage could still be running.

A stage object tracks multiple `StageInfo` objects to pass to Spark listeners or the web UI.

The latest `StageInfo` for the most recent attempt for a stage is accessible through `latestInfo`.

=== [[cache-tracking]] Cache Tracking

DAGScheduler tracks which RDDs are cached to avoid recomputing them and likewise remembers which shuffle map stages have already produced output files to avoid redoing the map side of a shuffle.

The internal `cacheLocs` is a map with keys being RDD ids and the values being arrays indexed by partition numbers. Each array value is the set of locations where that RDD partition is cached.

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME:

* A diagram would be awesome.
* Review the use of `cacheLocs`
====

If link:spark-rdd-caching.adoc[a storage level of an RDD is NONE], there is no need to get locations from link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[block manager]. Otherwise, `RDDBlockId` is created and Block Manager gets asked for locations.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `TaskLocation`

=== [[preferred-locations]] Preferred Locations

DAGScheduler computes where to run each task in a stage based on link:spark-rdd.adoc#preferred-locations[the preferred locations of its underlying RDDs], or <<cache-tracking, the location of cached or shuffle data>>.

=== [[adaptive-query-planning]] Adaptive Query Planning

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9850[SPARK-9850 Adaptive execution in Spark] for the design document. The work is currently in progress.

https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L661[DAGScheduler.submitMapStage] method is used for adaptive query planning, to run map stages and look at statistics about their outputs before submitting downstream stages.

=== ScheduledExecutorService daemon services

DAGScheduler uses the following ScheduledThreadPoolExecutors (with the policy of removing cancelled tasks from a work queue at time of cancellation):

* `dag-scheduler-message` - a daemon thread pool using `j.u.c.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with core pool size `1`. It is used to post `ResubmitFailedStages` when `FetchFailed` is reported.

CAUTION: FIXME When are FetchFaileds reported?

They are created using `ThreadUtils.newDaemonSingleThreadScheduledExecutor` method that uses Guava DSL to instantiate a ThreadFactory.

=== [[submitMissingTasks]] submitMissingTasks for Stage and Job

`DAGScheduler.submitMissingTasks(stage: Stage, jobId: Int)` is called when the parent stages of the current `stage` stage have already been finished and it is now possible to run tasks for it.

In the logs, you should see the following DEBUG message:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: submitMissingTasks([stage])
```

`pendingPartitions` internal field of the stage is cleared (it is later filled out with the partitions to run tasks for).

The stage is asked for partitions to compute (see link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc#findMissingPartitions[findMissingPartitions] in Stages).

The method adds the stage to `runningStages`.

The stage is told to be started to link:spark-service-outputcommitcoordinator.adoc[OutputCommitCoordinator] (using `outputCommitCoordinator.stageStart`)

CAUTION: FIXME Review `outputCommitCoordinator.stageStart`

The mapping between task ids and task preferred locations is computed (see <<computing-preferred-locations, getPreferredLocs - Computing Preferred Locations for Tasks and Partitions>>).

A new stage attempt is created (using `Stage.makeNewStageAttempt`).

`SparkListenerStageSubmitted` is posted.

CAUTION: FIXME `SparkEnv.get.closureSerializer.newInstance()`

The stage is serialized and broadcast to workers using link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-broadcast-variables[SparkContext.broadcast] method, i.e. it is `Serializer.serialize` to calculate `taskBinaryBytes` - an array of bytes of (rdd, func) for `ResultStage` and (rdd, shuffleDep) for `ShuffleMapStage`.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `taskBinaryBytes`.

When serializing the stage fails, the stage is removed from the internal `runningStages` set, `abortStage` is called and the method stops.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `abortStage`.

At this point in time, the stage is on workers.

For each partition to compute for the stage, a collection of <<spark-taskscheduler.adoc#shufflemaptask, ShuffleMapTask>> for ShuffleMapStage or
`ResultTask` for ResultStage is created.

CAUTION: FIXME Image with creating tasks for partitions in the stage.

If there are tasks to launch (there are missing partitions in the stage), the following INFO and DEBUG messages are in the logs:

```
INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting [tasks.size] missing tasks from [stage] ([stage.rdd])
DEBUG DAGScheduler: New pending partitions: [stage.pendingPartitions]
```

All tasks in the collection become a link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] for link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler.submitTasks].

In case of no tasks to be submitted for a stage, a DEBUG message shows up in the logs.

For ShuffleMapStage:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: Stage [stage] is actually done; (available: ${stage.isAvailable},available outputs: ${stage.numAvailableOutputs},partitions: ${stage.numPartitions})
```

For ResultStage:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: Stage ${stage} is actually done; (partitions: ${stage.numPartitions})
```

=== [[computing-preferred-locations]] getPreferredLocs - Computing Preferred Locations for Tasks and Partitions

CAUTION: FIXME Review + why does the method return a sequence of TaskLocations?

NOTE: Task ids correspond to partition ids.

=== [[stopping]] Stopping

When a DAGScheduler stops (via `stop()`), it stops the internal `dag-scheduler-message` thread pool, <<event-loop, dag-scheduler-event-loop>>, and link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler].

=== [[metrics]] Metrics

Spark's DAGScheduler uses link:spark-metrics.adoc[Spark Metrics System] (via `DAGSchedulerSource`) to report metrics about internal status.

The name of the source is *DAGScheduler*.

It emits the following numbers:

* *stage.failedStages* - the number of failed stages
* *stage.runningStages* - the number of running stages
* *stage.waitingStages* - the number of waiting stages
* *job.allJobs* - the number of all jobs
* *job.activeJobs* - the number of active jobs

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.test.noStageRetry` (default: `false`) - if enabled, FetchFailed will not cause stage retry, in order to surface the problem. Used for testing.
