== SessionState

`SessionState` is a layer for isolating state across sessions, including SQL configuration, tables, functions, UDFs, and everything else that accepts a `org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SQLConf`.

CAUTION: FIXME How is so?

It requires a `SparkSession` and manages its own `SQLConf`.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `SparkSession`? `SQLConf`?

NOTE: Given the package `org.apache.spark.sql.internal` that `SessionState` belongs to, this one is truly _internal_. You've been warned.

NOTE: `SessionState` is a `private[sql]` class.

`SessionState` offers the following services:

* <<newHadoopConf, newHadoopConf>>

=== [[newHadoopConf]] newHadoopConf

[source, scala]
----
newHadoopConf(): Configuration
----

`newHadoopConf` returns Hadoop's `Configuration` that it builds using link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#hadoopConfiguration[SparkContext.hadoopConfiguration] (through `SparkSession`) with all configuration settings added.

NOTE: `newHadoopConf` is used by link:spark-sql-queryplanner.adoc#HiveSessionState[HiveSessionState] (for `HiveSessionCatalog`), `ScriptTransformation`, `ParquetRelation`, `StateStoreRDD`, and `SessionState` itself, and few other places.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `ScriptTransformation`? `StateStoreRDD`?
