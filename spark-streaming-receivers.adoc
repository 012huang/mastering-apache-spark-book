== Receivers

A *receiver* runs on worker nodes to receive external data.

It is represented as `abstract class Receiver` that is parameterized by link:spark-rdd-caching.adoc#storage-levels[StorageLevel].

It is identified by the unique identifier `Receiver.streamId` (and corresponds to the unique identifier of the receiver input stream it is associated with).
