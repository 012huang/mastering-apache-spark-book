== [[ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator]] ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator

`ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` is a Scala http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Iterator.html[Iterator] that fetches multiple shuffle blocks (from local and remote BlockManagers).

`ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` allows for <<next, iterating over a sequence of blocks>> as `(BlockId, InputStream)` pairs so a caller can handle shuffle blocks in a pipelined fashion as they are received.

`ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` <<fetchUpToMaxBytes, throttles the remote fetches>> to avoid using too much memory.

| Description

| [[results]] `results`
| Internal FIFO blocking queue (using Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html[java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue]) to hold `FetchResult` remote and local fetch results.

Used in:

1. <<next, next>> to take one `FetchResult` off the queue,

2. <<sendRequest, sendRequest>> to put `SuccessFetchResult` or `FailureFetchResult` remote fetch results (as part of `BlockFetchingListener` callback),

3. <<fetchLocalBlocks, fetchLocalBlocks>> (similarly to <<sendRequest, sendRequest>>) to put local fetch results,

4. <<cleanup, cleanup>> to release managed buffers for `SuccessFetchResult` results.

| [[bytesInFlight]] `bytesInFlight`

| [[reqsInFlight]] `reqsInFlight`

[TIP]
====
Enable `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` or `TRACE` logging levels for `org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` logger to see what happens in `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator`.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator=TRACE

=== [[initialize]] Initializing ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator -- `initialize` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
initialize(): Unit
----

`initialize` registers a task cleanup and fetches shuffle blocks from remote and local link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManagers].

Internally, `initialize` link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc#addTaskCompletionListener[registers a `TaskCompletionListener`] (that will <<cleanup, clean up>> right after the task finishes).

`initialize` <<splitLocalRemoteBlocks, splitLocalRemoteBlocks>>.

`initialize` <<fetchRequests, registers the new remote fetch requests (with `fetchRequests` internal registry)>>.

As `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` is in initialization phase, `initialize` makes sure that `reqsInFlight` and `bytesInFlight` are both `0`. Otherwise, `initialize` throws an exception.

`initialize` <<fetchUpToMaxBytes, fetches shuffle blocks>> (from remote link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManagers]).

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Started [numFetches] remote fetches in [time] ms
```

`initialize` <<fetchLocalBlocks, fetches local shuffle blocks>>.

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Got local blocks in  [time] ms
```

NOTE: `initialize` is used when <<creating-instance, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` is created>>.

=== [[sendRequest]] Sending Remote Shuffle Block Fetch Request -- `sendRequest` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
sendRequest(req: FetchRequest): Unit
----

Internally, when `sendRequest` runs, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Sending request for [blocks.size] blocks ([size] B) from [hostPort]
```

`sendRequest` increments <<bytesInFlight, bytesInFlight>> and <<reqsInFlight, reqsInFlight>> internal counters.

NOTE: The input `FetchRequest` contains the remote link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#BlockManagerId[BlockManagerId] address and the shuffle blocks to fetch (as a sequence of link:spark-blockdatamanager.adoc#BlockId[BlockId] and their sizes).

`sendRequest` link:spark-shuffleclient.adoc#fetchBlocks[requests `ShuffleClient` to fetch shuffle blocks] (from the host, the port, and the executor as defined in the input `FetchRequest`).

NOTE: `ShuffleClient` was defined when <<creating-instance, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` was created>>.

`sendRequest` registers a `BlockFetchingListener` with `ShuffleClient` that:

1. <<sendRequest-BlockFetchingListener-onBlockFetchSuccess, For every successfully fetched shuffle block>> adds it as `SuccessFetchResult` to <<results, results>> internal queue.

2. <<sendRequest-BlockFetchingListener-onBlockFetchFailure, For every shuffle block fetch failure>> adds it as `FailureFetchResult` to <<results, results>> internal queue.

NOTE: `sendRequest` is used exclusively when <<fetchUpToMaxBytes, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` fetches remote shuffle blocks>>.

==== [[sendRequest-BlockFetchingListener-onBlockFetchSuccess]] onBlockFetchSuccess Callback

[source, scala]
----
onBlockFetchSuccess(blockId: String, buf: ManagedBuffer): Unit
----

Internally, `onBlockFetchSuccess` checks if the <<isZombie, iterator is not zombie>> and does the further processing if it is not.

`onBlockFetchSuccess` marks the input `blockId` as received (i.e. removes it from all the blocks to fetch as requested in <<sendRequest, sendRequest>>).

`onBlockFetchSuccess` adds the managed `buf` (as `SuccessFetchResult`) to <<results, results>> internal queue.

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: remainingBlocks: [blocks]
```

Regardless of zombie state of `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator`, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Got remote block [blockId] after [time] ms
```

==== [[sendRequest-BlockFetchingListener-onBlockFetchFailure]] onBlockFetchFailure Callback

[source, scala]
----
onBlockFetchFailure(blockId: String, e: Throwable): Unit
----

When `onBlockFetchFailure` is called, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Failed to get block(s) from [hostPort]
```

`onBlockFetchFailure` adds the block (as `FailureFetchResult`) to <<results, results>> internal queue.

=== [[throwFetchFailedException]] Throwing FetchFailedException (for ShuffleBlockId) -- `throwFetchFailedException` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
throwFetchFailedException(
  blockId: BlockId,
  address: BlockManagerId,
  e: Throwable): Nothing
----

`throwFetchFailedException` throws a link:spark-TaskRunner-FetchFailedException.adoc[FetchFailedException] when the input `blockId` is a `ShuffleBlockId`.

NOTE: `throwFetchFailedException` creates a `FetchFailedException` passing on the root cause of a failure, i.e. the input `e`.

Otherwise, `throwFetchFailedException` throws a `SparkException`:

```
Failed to get block [blockId], which is not a shuffle block
```

NOTE: `throwFetchFailedException` is used when <<next, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` is requested for the next element>>.

=== [[cleanup]] Releasing Resources -- `cleanup` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
cleanup(): Unit
----

Internally, `cleanup` marks `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` a <<isZombie, zombie>>.

`cleanup` <<releaseCurrentResultBuffer, releases the current result buffer>>.

`cleanup` iterates over <<results, results>> internal queue and for every `SuccessFetchResult`, increments remote bytes read and blocks fetched shuffle task metrics, and eventually releases the managed buffer.

NOTE: `cleanup` is used when <<initialize, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` initializes itself>>.
