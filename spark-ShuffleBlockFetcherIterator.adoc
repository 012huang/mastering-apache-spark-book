=== [[throwFetchFailedException]] Throwing FetchFailedException (for ShuffleBlockId) -- `throwFetchFailedException` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
throwFetchFailedException(
  blockId: BlockId,
  address: BlockManagerId,
  e: Throwable): Nothing
----

`throwFetchFailedException` throws a link:spark-TaskRunner-FetchFailedException.adoc[FetchFailedException] when the input `blockId` is a `ShuffleBlockId`.

NOTE: `throwFetchFailedException` creates a `FetchFailedException` passing on the root cause of a failure, i.e. the input `e`.

Otherwise, `throwFetchFailedException` throws a `SparkException`:

```
Failed to get block [blockId], which is not a shuffle block
```

NOTE: `throwFetchFailedException` is used when <<next `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` is requested for the next element>>.
