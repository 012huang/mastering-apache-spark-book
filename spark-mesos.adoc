== Spark on Mesos

From https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/09/09/four-reasons-pay-attention-to-apache-mesos/[Four reasons to pay attention to Apache Mesos]:

> Spark workloads can also be sensitive to the physical characteristics of the infrastructure, such as memory size of the node, access to fast solid state disk, or proximity to the data source.

> to run Spark workloads well you need a resource manager that not only can handle the rapid swings in load inherent in analytics processing, but one that can do to smartly. Matching of the task to the RIGHT resources is crucial and awareness of the physical environment is a must. Mesos is designed to manage this problem on behalf of workloads like Spark.
