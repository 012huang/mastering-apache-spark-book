== web UI and Streaming Statistics Page

When you link:spark-streaming-streamingcontext.adoc#start[start a Spark Streaming application], you can use link:spark-webui.adoc[web UI] to monitor streaming statistics in *Streaming* tab (aka _page_).

.Streaming Tab in web UI

The page is made up of three sections (aka _tables_) - the unnamed, top-level one with <<basic-info, basic information>> about the streaming application (right below the title *Streaming Statistics*), <<active-batches, Active Batches>> and <<catched-batches, Completed Batches>>.

NOTE: The Streaming page uses link:spark-streaming-streaminglisteners.adoc#StreamingJobProgressListener[StreamingJobProgressListener] for most of the information displayed.

=== [[basic-info]] Basic Information

This is the top-level section in the Streaming page with basic information about the streaming application.

It shows the link:spark-streaming-dstreamgraph.adoc#batchDuration[batch duration] (after _Running batches of_), and the time it runs for and since link:spark-streaming-streamingcontext.adoc#creating-instance[StreamingContext was created] (_not_ when this streaming application has been started).

It shows the number of *completed batches* and *received records* (in parenthesis).

Below is the table for link:spark-streaming-streaminglisteners.adoc#retainedBatches[Retained Batches] (i.e. waiting, running, and completed batches).

In *Input Rate* row, you can show and hide details of each input stream.

If there are link:spark-streaming-receiverinputdstreams.adoc[input streams with receivers], the numbers of all the receivers and active ones are displayed.

The average event rate for all registered streams is displayed (as _Avg: [avg] events/sec_).

*Scheduling Delay* is the time spent from...FIXME

*Processing Time* is the time spent to run all jobs of a batch.

*Total Delay* is the time spent from submitting to complete all jobs of a batch.

CAUTION: FIXME Check these times and their definitions out _again_!

=== [[active-batches]] Active Batches

*Active Batches* section presents `waitingBatches` and `runningBatches` together.

=== [[completed-batches]] Completed Batches

*Completed Batches* section presents `completedBatchUIData`.
