== GraphX

Apache Spark comes with a library for executing distributed computation on graph data, http://spark.apache.org/graphx/[GraphX].

From the article http://themsphub.com/merging-datasets-using-graph-analytics/[Merging Datasets Using Graph Analytics]:

> A popular model of distributed computation on graphs known as Pregel was published by Google researchers in 2010. Pregel is based on passing messages along the graph edges in a series of iterations. Accordingly, it is a good fit for the Gale–Shapley algorithm, which starts with each “gentleman” (a vertex on one side of the bipartite graph) sending a marriage proposal to its most preferred single “lady” (a vertex on the other side of the bipartite graph). The “ladies” then marry their most preferred suitors, after which the process is repeated until there are no more proposals to be made.
