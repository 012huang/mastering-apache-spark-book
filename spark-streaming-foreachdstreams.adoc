== ForEachDStreams

`ForEachDStream` is an internal link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc[DStream] that depends on a parent stream (given as `parent`) with the exact same `slideDuration`.

The `compute` method returns no RDD.

When `generateJob` is called, it returns a streaming job for a batch when `parent` stream does. And if so, it uses the "foreach" function (given as `foreachFunc`) to work on the RDDs generated.

[NOTE]
====
Although it may seem that `ForEachDStreams` are by design output streams they are not. You have to use link:spark-streaming-dstreamgraph.adoc[DStreamGraph.addOutputStream] to register a stream as output.

You use link:spark-streaming-dstreams.adoc#operators[stream operators] that do the registration as part of their operation, like `print`.
