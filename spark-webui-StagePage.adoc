== [[StagePage]] Stage Details

`StagePage` renders a page available under `/stage` URL that requires two <<parameters, request parameters>> -- `id` and `attempt`, e.g. http://localhost:4040/stages/stage/?id=2&attempt=0.

It is a part of link:spark-webui-stages.adoc[StagesTab].

It uses the parent's link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc[JobProgressListener] and `RDDOperationGraphListener` to calculate the <<metrics, metrics>>.

=== [[summary-task-metrics]] Summary Metrics for Completed Tasks in Stage

The summary metrics table shows the metrics for tasks in a given stage that have already finished with SUCCESS status and for which there are metrics available.

The table consists of the following columns: *Metric*, *Min*, *25th percentile*, *Median*, *75th percentile*, *Max*.

.Summary Metrics for Completed Tasks in Stage
image::images/spark-webui-stage-summary-metrics-tasks.png[align="center"]

CAUTION: FIXME How are the summaries computed?

The 1st row is *Duration*.

The 2nd row is the optional *Scheduler Delay* which includes the time to ship the task from the scheduler to executors, and the time to send the task result from the executors to the scheduler. It is not enabled by default and you should select *Scheduler Delay* checkbox under *Show Additional Metrics* to include it in the summary table.

TIP: If Scheduler Delay is large, consider decreasing the size of tasks or decreasing the size of task results.

The 3rd row is the optional *Task Deserialization Time*. It is not enabled by default and you should select *Task Deserialization Time* checkbox under *Show Additional Metrics* to include it in the summary table.

The 4th row is *GC Time* which is the time that an executor spent paused for Java garbage collection while the task was running.

The 5th row is the optional *Result Serialization Time* which is the time spent serializing the task result on a executor before sending it back to the driver. It is not enabled by default and you should select *Result Serialization Time* checkbox under *Show Additional Metrics* to include it in the summary table.

The 6th row is the optional *Getting Result Time* which is the time that the driver spends fetching task results from workers. It is not enabled by default and you should select *Getting Result Time* checkbox under *Show Additional Metrics* to include it in the summary table.

TIP: If Getting Result Time is large, consider decreasing the amount of data returned from each task.

If <<spark.sql.unsafe.enabled, Tungsten is enabled>> (it is by default), the 7th row is the optional *Peak Execution Memory* which is the sum of the peak sizes of the internal data structures created during shuffles, aggregations and joins. For SQL jobs, this only tracks all unsafe operators, broadcast joins, and external sort. It is not enabled by default and you should select *Peak Execution Memory* checkbox under *Show Additional Metrics* to include it in the summary table.

If the stage has an input, the 8th row is *Input Size / Records* which is the bytes and records read from Hadoop or from a Spark storage.

If the stage has an output, the 9th row is *Output Size / Records* which is the bytes and records written to Hadoop or to a Spark storage.

If the stage has shuffle read there will be three more rows in the table. The first row is *Shuffle Read Blocked Time* which is the time that tasks spent blocked waiting for shuffle data to be read from remote machines. The other row is *Shuffle Read Size / Records* which is the total shuffle bytes and records read (including both data read locally and data read from remote executors). And the last row is *Shuffle Remote Reads* which is the total shuffle bytes read from remote executors (which is a subset of the shuffle read bytes; the remaining shuffle data is read locally).

If the stage has shuffle write, the following row is *Shuffle Write Size / Records*.

If the stage has bytes spilled, the following two rows are *Shuffle spill (memory)* and *Shuffle spill (disk)*.

=== Aggregated Metrics by Executor

`ExecutorTable` table shows the following columns:

* Executor ID
* Address
* Task Time
* Total Tasks
* Failed Tasks
* Killed Tasks
* Succeeded Tasks
* (optional) Input Size / Records (only when the stage has an input)
* (optional) Output Size / Records (only when the stage has an output)
* (optional) Shuffle Read Size / Records (only when the stage read bytes for a shuffle)
* (optional) Shuffle Write Size / Records (only when the stage wrote bytes for a shuffle)
* (optional) Shuffle Spill (Memory) (only when the stage spilled memory bytes)
* (optional) Shuffle Spill (Disk) (only when the stage spilled bytes to disk)

.Aggregated Metrics by Executor
image::images/spark-webui-stage-aggregated-metrics-by-executor.png[align="center"]

It gets `executorSummary` from `StageUIData` (for the stage and stage attempt id) and creates rows per executor.

It also link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc#blockManagerIds[requests BlockManagers (from JobProgressListener)] to map executor ids to a pair of host and port to display in Address column.

=== [[accumulators]] Accumulators

Stage page displays the table with link:spark-accumulators.adoc#named[named accumulators] (only if they exist). It contains the name and value of the accumulators.

.Accumulators Section

NOTE: The information with name and value is stored in link:spark-accumulators.adoc#AccumulableInfo[AccumulableInfo] (that is available in link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc#StageUIData[StageUIData]).
