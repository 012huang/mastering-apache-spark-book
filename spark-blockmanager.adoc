== Block Manager


The underlying abstraction for blocks in Spark is a `ByteBuffer` that limits the size of a block to 2GB (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` - see http://stackoverflow.com/q/8076472/1305344[Why does FileChannel.map take up to Integer.MAX_VALUE of data?] and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1476[SPARK-1476 2GB limit in spark for blocks]). This has implication not just for managed blocks in use, but also for shuffle blocks (memory mapped blocks are limited to 2GB, even though the API allows for `long`), ser-deser via byte array-backed output streams.
