== Debugging Spark using sbt

Use `sbt -jvm-debug 5005`, connect to the remote JVM at the port `5005` using IntelliJ IDEA, place breakpoints on the desired lines of the source code of Spark.

```
âžœ  sparkme-app  sbt -jvm-debug 5005
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
...
```

Run Spark context and the breakpoints get triggered.

```
scala> val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
15/11/14 22:58:46 INFO SparkContext: Running Spark version 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT
```
