== Source

`Source` represents a continuous data stream for a streaming query. It generates batches of link:spark-sql-dataframe.adoc[DataFrame] for given start and end offsets. For fault tolerance, a source must be able to replay data given a start offset.

`Source` trait has the following features:

* *schema* of the data (as link:spark-sql-dataframe.adoc#StructType[StructType] using `schema` method)
* the maximum *offset* (of type `Offset` using `getOffset` method)
* Returns a *batch* for start and end offsets (of type DataFrame).

It lives in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming` package.

* <<MemoryStream, MemoryStream>>
