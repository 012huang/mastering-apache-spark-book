== [[BroadcastFactory]] `BroadcastFactory` -- Pluggable Broadcast Variable Factory

`BroadcastFactory` is the pluggable interface for factories of link:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast variables] in Spark.

NOTE: Spark does not use the pluggable interface of `BroadcastFactory` to create any other factories but link:spark-TorrentBroadcastFactory.adoc[TorrentBroadcastFactory].

`BroadcastFactory` is exclusively used and instantiated inside of `BroadcastManager`.
