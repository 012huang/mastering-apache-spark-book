CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[resolver]] `resolver` Method

`resolver` gives case-sensitive or case-insensitive `Resolvers` per <<caseSensitiveAnalysis, caseSensitiveAnalysis>> setting.

NOTE: `Resolver` is a mere function of two `String` parameters that returns `true` if both refer to the same entity (i.e. for case insensitive equality).

=== [[optimizerMaxIterations]] `optimizerMaxIterations` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

[NOTE]
====
`optimizerMaxIterations` is used when:

* `Analyzer` link:spark-sql-Analyzer.adoc#creating-instance[is created]

* `Optimizer` link:spark-sql-catalyst-Optimizer.adoc#fixedPoint[creates the `FixedPoint`]
