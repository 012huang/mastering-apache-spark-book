== Shuffle Service

The name appears https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/2da3a9e98e5d129d4507b5db01bba5ee9558d28e[here], twice in link:building_spark.adoc[the build's output] and others. It's something important quite a bit then, isn't it?

Review the code in `network/shuffle` module.

When is data eligible for shuffling?
