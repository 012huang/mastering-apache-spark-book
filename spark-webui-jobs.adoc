== [[JobsTab]] Jobs Tab

The *Jobs Tab* shows status of all Spark jobs in a Spark application (i.e. a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext]).

The Jobs tab is available under `/jobs` URL, i.e. http://localhost:4040/jobs.

The Jobs tab consists of two pages, i.e. <<AllJobsPage, AllJobsPage>> and <<JobPage, JobPage>>.

Internally, the Jobs Tab is represented by `JobsTab` class that is a custom `SparkUITab` with `jobs` prefix.

NOTE: The Jobs tab uses link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc[JobProgressListener] to access statistics of job executions in a Spark application to display.

=== [[AllJobsPage]] `AllJobsPage` Page

`AllJobsPage` is a custom `WebUIPage` that renders active, completed, and failed jobs.

TIP: Jobs (in any state) are displayed when their number is greater than `0`.

`AllJobsPage` displays the *Summary* section with the current Spark user, total uptime, scheduling mode, and the number of jobs per status.

Under the summary section is the *Event Timeline* section followed by *Active Jobs*, *Completed Jobs*, and *Failed Jobs* sections.

Jobs are clickable, i.e. you can click on a job to see information about the stages of tasks inside it.

When you hover over a job in Event Timeline not only you see the job legend but also the job is highlighted in the Summary section.

The Event Timeline section shows not only jobs but also executors.

TIP: Use link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#dynamic-allocation[Programmable Dynamic Allocation in `SparkContext`] to manage executors for demo purposes.
