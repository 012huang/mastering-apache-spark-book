== SparkContext - the door to Spark

CAUTION: FIXME Review the code of `SparkContext`

From the scaladoc of  http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkContext[org.apache.spark.SparkContext]:

> *SparkContext* is the main entry point for Spark functionality.
> A SparkContext represents the connection to a Spark cluster,
> and can be used to create RDDs, accumulators and broadcast variables on that cluster.

As you may have read in the above scaladoc, you use `SparkContext` for the following group of functionalities:

* link:spark-cluster.adoc[Connect to a cluster]
* link:spark-configuration.adoc[Specify mandatory application name]
* link:spark-rdd.adoc[Create RDDs]
* link:spark-broadcast.adoc[Create broadcast variables]
* link:spark-accumulators.adoc[Use accumulators]
* Use services, e.g. link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[Task Scheduler], link:spark-listeners.adoc[Listener Bus], link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager], <<coarse-grained-scheduler-backends, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends>>, link:spark-shuffle-service.adoc[Shuffle Service].

=== [[master-urls]] Master URLs

Spark supports the following master URLs (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L2729-L2742[private object SparkMasterRegex]):

* *local*, *local[N]* and *local[{asterisk}]* for link:spark-local.adoc[Spark local]
* *local[N, maxRetries]* for link:spark-local.adoc[Spark local-with-retries]
* *local-cluster[N, cores, memory]* for simulating a Spark cluster of [N, cores, memory] locally
* *spark://host:port,host1:port1,...* for connecting to link:spark-standalone.adoc[Spark Standalone cluster(s)]
* *mesos://* or *zk://* for link:spark-mesos.adoc[Spark on Mesos cluster]
* *yarn-cluster* (deprecated: *yarn-standalone*) for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN (cluster mode)]
* *yarn-client* for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN cluster (client mode)]
* *simr://* for Simr cluster

You use a master URL with link:spark-submit.adoc[spark-submit for `--master` command-line option] or <<creating-sparkcontext, when creating SparkContext with `setMaster` method>>.

=== Instantiating Scheduler Backend and Task Scheduler

`SparkContext.createTaskScheduler` is executed as part of SparkContext's initialization to create a link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[task scheduler] (based on a given master URL) and link:spark-execution-model.adoc#scheduler-backends[scheduler backend].

==== [[executor-allocation-client]] ExecutorAllocationClient and CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends

SparkContext is an *ExecutorAllocationClient* for link:spark-execution-model.adoc#scheduler-backends[CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends], i.e. a client that communicates with a (coarse-grain) cluster manager to request or kill executors.

=== [[creating-sparkcontext]] Creating SparkContext

You create a `SparkContext` instance using link:spark-configuration.adoc[Spark application's configuration] using a `SparkConfig` object.

```
scala> import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf

scala> val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[*]").setAppName("Hello world!")
conf: org.apache.spark.SparkConf = org.apache.spark.SparkConf@7a8f69d6

scala> import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext

scala> val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
sc: org.apache.spark.SparkContext = org.apache.spark.SparkContext@50ee2523
```

=== SparkContext in Spark shell

In link:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell], an instance of `SparkContext` is automatically created for you under the name `sc`.

You should see the name in the logs while `spark-shell` starts.

```
$ ./bin/spark-shell
Spark context available as sc.
SQL context available as sqlContext.

```

`SparkContext` allows you to create many different RDDs from input sources like:

* Scala's collections, i.e. `sc.parallelize(0 to 100)`
* local or remote filesystems, i.e. `sc.textFile("README.md")`
* Any Hadoop `InputSource`, i.e.
+
```
sc.newAPIHadoopFile("filepath1, filepath2", classOf[NewTextInputFormat], classOf[LongWritable], classOf[Text])
```

Refer to link:spark-files.adoc[Using Files] to find out more on the IO API to create RDDs.

You can also use `SparkContext` to create counters and link:spark-accumulators.adoc[accumulators].

Using `SparkContext` allows you to configure Spark context, i.e. properties that govern things like link:spark-cluster.adoc[master URL], link:spark-hadoop.adoc[Hadoop API], etc.

=== SparkContext as the global configuration of services

SparkContext keeps track of:

* shuffle ids using `nextShuffleId` internal field for link:spark-scheduler.adoc#ShuffleMapStage[registering shuffle dependencies] to link:spark-shuffle-service.adoc[Shuffle Service].

=== Others

I'm unsure where to put them, but since I found them interesting, they should be _somewhere_.

==== spark.driver.allowMultipleContexts

Found in the scaladoc of  http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkContext[org.apache.spark.SparkContext]:

> Only one SparkContext may be active per JVM. You must `stop()` the active SparkContext before creating a new one.

The above quote is not necessarily correct when `spark.driver.allowMultipleContexts` is `true` (default: `false`). If `true`, Spark logs warnings instead of throwing exceptions when multiple SparkContexts are active, i.e. no other SparkContext is running in this JVM. Upon creating an instance of `SparkContext`, Spark marks the current thread as having it being created (very early in the instantiation process).

==== SparkContext.addJar / --jars

The jar you specify with `SparkContext.addJar` will be copied to all the worker nodes.

From http://deploymentzone.com/2015/01/30/spark-and-merged-csv-files/[SPARK AND MERGED CSV FILES]:

> Spark is like Hadoop - uses Hadoop, in fact - for performing actions like outputting data to HDFS. You'll know what I mean the first time you try to save "all-the-data.csv" and are surprised to find a directory named all-the-data.csv/ containing a 0 byte _SUCCESS file and then several part-0000n files for each partition that took part in the job.

==== Gotchas - things to watch for

Even you don't access it explicitly it cannot be referenced inside a closure as it is serialized and carried around across executors.
