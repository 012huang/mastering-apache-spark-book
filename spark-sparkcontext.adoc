== SparkContext - the door to Spark

*SparkContext* (aka *Spark context*) represents the connection to a Spark execution environment, called link:spark-deployment-modes.adoc[deployment mode], and can only then be used to create RDDs, accumulators and broadcast variables, access Spark services and run jobs.

A Spark context is essentially a client of Spark.

You use `SparkContext` for the following functions:

* link:spark-cluster.adoc[Connect to a cluster]
* link:spark-configuration.adoc[Specify mandatory application name]
* <<creating-rdds, Creating RDDs>>
* link:spark-broadcast.adoc[Create broadcast variables]
* link:spark-accumulators.adoc[Use accumulators]
* Access services, e.g. link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[Task Scheduler], link:spark-scheduler-listeners.adoc[Listener Bus], link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager], <<coarse-grained-scheduler-backends, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends>>, link:spark-shuffle-service.adoc[Shuffle Service].
* <<running-jobs, Run jobs>>

Read the scaladoc of  http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkContext[org.apache.spark.SparkContext].

=== [[creating-sparkcontext]] Creating SparkContext

You create a `SparkContext` instance using link:spark-configuration.adoc[Spark application's configuration] using a `SparkConfig` object.

```
scala> import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf

scala> val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[*]").setAppName("Hello world!")
conf: org.apache.spark.SparkConf = org.apache.spark.SparkConf@7a8f69d6

scala> import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext

scala> val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
sc: org.apache.spark.SparkContext = org.apache.spark.SparkContext@50ee2523
```

Only one SparkContext may be running in a single JVM (check out https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2243[SPARK-2243 Support multiple SparkContexts in the same JVM]). Sharing access to a SparkContext in the JVM is the solution to share data within Spark (without relying on other means of data sharing using external data stores).


==== spark.driver.allowMultipleContexts

Quoting the scaladoc of  http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkContext[org.apache.spark.SparkContext]:

> Only one SparkContext may be active per JVM. You must `stop()` the active SparkContext before creating a new one.

The above quote is not necessarily correct when `spark.driver.allowMultipleContexts` is `true` (default: `false`). If `true`, Spark logs warnings instead of throwing exceptions when multiple SparkContexts are active, i.e. multiple SparkContext are running in this JVM. When creating an instance of `SparkContext`, Spark marks the current thread as having it being created (very early in the instantiation process).

CAUTION: It's not guaranteed that Spark will work properly with two or more SparkContexts. Consider the feature a work in progress.

=== [[sparkcontext-and-rdd]] SparkContext and RDDs

You use a Spark context to create RDDs (see <<creating-rdds, Creating RDD>>).

When an RDD is created, it belongs to and is completely owned by the Spark context it originated from. RDDs can't by design be shared between SparkContexts.

.A Spark context creates a living space for RDDs.

=== SparkContext in Spark shell

In link:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell], an instance of `SparkContext` is automatically created for you under the name `sc`.

Read link:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell].

=== [[creating-rdds]] Creating RDD

`SparkContext` allows you to create many different RDDs from input sources like:

* Scala's collections, i.e. `sc.parallelize(0 to 100)`
* local or remote filesystems, i.e. `sc.textFile("README.md")`
* Any Hadoop `InputSource` using `sc.newAPIHadoopFile`

Read link:spark-rdd.adoc#creating-rdds[Creating RDDs] in link:spark-rdd.adoc[RDD - Resilient Distributed Dataset].

=== SparkContext.addJar / --jars

The jar you specify with `SparkContext.addJar` will be copied to all the worker nodes.

From http://deploymentzone.com/2015/01/30/spark-and-merged-csv-files/[SPARK AND MERGED CSV FILES]:

> Spark is like Hadoop - uses Hadoop, in fact - for performing actions like outputting data to HDFS. You'll know what I mean the first time you try to save "all-the-data.csv" and are surprised to find a directory named all-the-data.csv/ containing a 0 byte _SUCCESS file and then several part-0000n files for each partition that took part in the job.

=== SparkContext as the global configuration for services

SparkContext keeps track of:

* shuffle ids using `nextShuffleId` internal field for link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#ShuffleMapStage[registering shuffle dependencies] to link:spark-shuffle-service.adoc[Shuffle Service].

=== [[running-jobs]] Running Jobs

All link:spark-rdd.adoc#actions[RDD actions] in Spark launch link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#jobs[jobs] (that are run on one or many partitions of the RDD) using `SparkContext.runJob(rdd: RDD[T], func: Iterator[T] => U): Array[U]`.

TIP: For some actions like `first()` and `lookup()`, there is no need to compute all the partitions of the RDD in a job. And Spark knows it.

[source,scala]
----
scala> import org.apache.spark.TaskContext
import org.apache.spark.TaskContext

scala> sc.runJob(lines, (t: TaskContext, i: Iterator[String]) => 1) // <1>
res0: Array[Int] = Array(1, 1)  // <2>
----
<1> Run a job using `runJob` on `lines` RDD with a function that returns 1 for every partition (of `lines` RDD).
<2> What can you say about the number of partitions of the `lines` RDD? Is your result `res0` different than mine? Why?

Running a job is essentially executing the `func` function on the `rdd` RDD and returning the result as an array (with elements being the results per partition).

`SparkContext.runJob` calls link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#runJob[DAGScheduler.runJob()]. Before the method finishes, it does link:spark-rdd-checkpointing.adoc[checkpointing]. It triggers posting `JobSubmitted` event (see <<event-loop,Event loop>>).

You can only run jobs when a Spark context is active, i.e. started. See <<stopping-spark-context, Stopping Spark context>>.

=== [[stopping-spark-context]] Stopping Spark Context

You can stop a Spark context using `SparkContext.stop` method. Stopping a Spark context stops a Spark application.

You have to create a new Spark context before using Spark features and services.

An attempt to use a Spark context after it was stopped will result in `java.lang.IllegalStateException: SparkContext has been shutdown`.

[source, scala]
----
scala> sc.stop
...
INFO SparkContext: Successfully stopped SparkContext

scala> sc.runJob(lines, (t: TaskContext, i: Iterator[Int]) => 1)
java.lang.IllegalStateException: SparkContext has been shutdown
  at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.runJob(SparkContext.scala:1812)
  at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.runJob(SparkContext.scala:1833)
  at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.runJob(SparkContext.scala:1910)
  ... 48 elided
----

=== [[custom-dagscheduler]] Custom DAGScheduler

By default, SparkContext uses (`private[spark]` class) `org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler`, but you can develop your own custom DAGScheduler implementation, and use (`private[spark]`) `SparkContext.dagScheduler_=(ds: DAGScheduler)` method to assign yours.

CAUTION: FIXME Make it an advanced exercise.

=== Creating Scheduler Backend and Task Scheduler

`SparkContext.createTaskScheduler` is executed as part of SparkContext's initialization to create a link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[task scheduler] (based on a link:spark-deployment-modes.adoc#master-urls[ given master URL]) and link:spark-execution-model.adoc#scheduler-backends[scheduler backend].

.SparkContext creates Task Scheduler and Scheduler Backend
image::diagrams/sparkcontext-createtaskscheduler.png[align="center"]

==== [[executor-allocation-client]] ExecutorAllocationClient and CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends

SparkContext is an *ExecutorAllocationClient* for link:spark-execution-model.adoc#scheduler-backends[CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackends], i.e. a client that communicates with a (coarse-grain) cluster manager to request or kill executors.
