== [[SortShuffleWriter]] SortShuffleWriter -- Fallback ShuffleWriter

`SortShuffleWriter` is a link:spark-ShuffleWriter.adoc[ShuffleWriter] that is used when link:spark-SortShuffleManager.adoc#getWriter[`SortShuffleManager` returns a `ShuffleWriter` for `ShuffleHandle`] (and the `ShuffleHandle` is not of type link:spark-SerializedShuffleHandle.adoc[SerializedShuffleHandle] or link:spark-BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle.adoc[BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle]).

[TIP]
====
Enable `ERROR` logging level for `org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.SortShuffleWriter` logger to see what happens in `SortShuffleWriter`.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.SortShuffleWriter=ERROR
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
