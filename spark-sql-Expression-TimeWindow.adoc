val timeColumn = window('time, "5 seconds")

scala> timeColumn.expr.numberedTreeString
res9: String =
00 timewindow('time, 5000000, 5000000, 0) AS window#1
01 +- timewindow('time, 5000000, 5000000, 0)
02    +- 'time

import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.TimeWindow
scala> val timeWindow = timeColumn.expr.children(0).asInstanceOf[TimeWindow]
