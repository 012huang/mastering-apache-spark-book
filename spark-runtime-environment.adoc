== Spark Runtime Environment

*Spark Runtime Environment* is the runtime environment for Spark services that interact with each other to build what we know as Spark - the distributed computing platform.

Spark uses a *master/slave architecture* in which there is a single coordinator, *master*, that hosts a *driver* and communicates with one or more distributed *workers* where *executors* operate.

CAUTION: FIXME Diagram of Spark architecture

The driver and the executors run in their own Java processes. You can run them all on the same (_horizontal cluster_) or separate machines (_vertical cluster_) or in a mixed machine configuration.

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.SparkEnv` logger to learn the low-level details of SparkEnv.

=== [[master]] Master

A *master* is a running Spark instance that...FIXME

=== [[worker]] Worker / Slave

*Workers* (aka *slaves*) are running Spark instances where executors live to execute tasks. They are the compute nodes in Spark.

CAUTION: FIXME How many executors are spawned per worker?

A worker receives serialized tasks that it runs in a thread pool.

It hosts a local link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager] that serves blocks to other workers in a Spark cluster. Workers communicate among themselves using their Block Manager instances.

CAUTION: FIXME Diagram of a driver with workers as boxes.

Explain task execution in Spark and understand Spark’s underlying execution model.

New vocabulary often faced in Spark UI

link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[When you create SparkContext], each worker starts an executor. This is a separate process (JVM), and it loads your jar, too. The executors connect back to your driver program. Now the driver can send them commands, like `flatMap`, `map` and `reduceByKey`. When the driver quits, the executors shut down.

A new process is not started for each step. A new process is started on each worker when the SparkContext is constructed.

The executor deserializes the command (this is possible because it has loaded your jar), and executes it on a partition.

Shortly speaking, an application in Spark is executed in three steps:

1. Create RDD graph, i.e. DAG (directed acyclic graph) of RDDs to represent entire computation.
1. Create stage graph, i.e. a DAG of stages that is a logical execution plan based on the RDD graph. Stages are created by breaking the RDD graph at shuffle boundaries.
1. Based on the plan, schedule and execute tasks on workers.

link:spark-examples-wordcount-spark-shell.adoc[In the WordCount example], the RDD graph is as follows:

file -> lines -> words -> per-word count -> global word count -> output

Based on this graph, two stages are created. The *stage* creation rule is based on the idea of *pipelining* as many link:spark-rdd.adoc[narrow transformations] as possible. RDD operations with "narrow" dependencies, like `map()` and `filter()`, are pipelined together into one set of tasks in each stage.

In the end, every stage will only have shuffle dependencies on other stages, and may compute multiple operations inside it.

In the WordCount example, the narrow transformation finishes at per-word count. Therefore, you get two stages:

* file -> lines -> words -> per-word count
* global word count -> output

Once stages are defined, Spark will generate tasks from stages. The first stage will create a series of <<spark-taskscheduler.adoc#shufflemaptask, ShuffleMapTask>> and the last stage will create ResultTasks because in the last stage, one action operation is included to produce results.

The number of tasks to be generated depends on how your files are distributed. Suppose that you have 3 three different files in three different nodes, the first stage will generate 3 tasks: one task per partition.

Therefore, you should not map your steps to tasks directly. A task belongs to a stage, and is related to a partition.

The number of tasks being generated in each stage will be equal to the number of partitions.

=== [[driver]] Driver

A *driver* is the process that launches the `main` method of your Spark application.

.Driver with the services
image::images/spark-driver.png[align="center"]

It splits a Spark application into tasks and schedules them to run on executors.

A driver is where the task scheduler lives and spawns tasks across workers.

A driver coordinates workers and overall execution of tasks.

Driver requires the additional services (beside the common ones like link:spark-shuffle-service.adoc[ShuffleManager], MemoryManager, BlockTransferService, link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc[BroadcastManager], link:spark-cachemanager.adoc[CacheManager]):

* Listener Bus
* driverActorSystemName
* link:spark-rpc.adoc[RPC Environment] (for Netty and Akka)
* link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc#MapOutputTrackerMaster[MapOutputTrackerMaster] with the name *MapOutputTracker*
* link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#BlockManagerMaster[BlockManagerMaster] with the name *BlockManagerMaster*
* link:spark-http-file-server.adoc[HttpFileServer]
* link:spark-metrics.adoc[MetricsSystem] with the name *driver*
* link:spark-service-outputcommitcoordinator.adoc[OutputCommitCoordinator] with the endpoint's name *OutputCommitCoordinator*

CAUTION: FIXME Diagram of RpcEnv for a driver (and later executors). Perhaps it should be in the notes about RpcEnv?

==== [[createDriverEnv]] SparkEnv.createDriverEnv

`SparkEnv.createDriverEnv` creates the Spark execution environment for a driver, aka *driver's (execution) environment*.

The method accepts an instance of link:spark-configuration.adoc[SparkConf], link:spark-deployment-modes.adoc[whether it runs in local mode or not], link:spark-scheduler-listeners.adoc#listener-bus[an instance of listener bus], the number of driver's cores to use for execution in local mode or `0` otherwise, and a link:spark-service-outputcommitcoordinator.adoc[OutputCommitCoordinator] (default: none).

The following two driver's properties are expected to be available in the Spark configuration:

* `spark.driver.host` - the hostname of the driver
* `spark.driver.port` - the port of the driver.

For Akka-based RPC Environment (obsolete since Spark 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT), the name of the actor system for the driver is *sparkDriver*. See link:spark-rpc.adoc#client-mode[clientMode] how it is created in detail.

=== [[executors]] Executors

*Executors* are distributed agents that run tasks for link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#jobs[a Spark job]. They typically run for the entire lifetime of the Spark application. They communicate with the driver to send computation results back.

Executors provide in-memory storage for RDDs that are cached in Spark applications (via link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager]).

When executors are started they register themselves with the driver and communicate directly to launch jobs (as tasks).

Internally, a Spark executor is backed by a thread pool to run tasks.

Each executor can run multiple tasks over its lifetime, both parallel and sequentially.

It’s recommended to have as many executors as data nodes and as many cores as you can get from the cluster.

An executor is described by id, hostname, classpath, environment (as `SparkEnv`), and whether it runs in link:spark-local.adoc[local] or link:spark-cluster.adoc[cluster mode].

When an executor is started the following message is printed out in the logs:

```
INFO Executor: Starting executor ID [executorId] on host [executorHostname]
INFO Executor: Using REPL class URI: http://192.168.1.4:56131
```

TIP: Enable `INFO` logging level for `org.apache.spark.executor.Executor` logger to see what happens under the hood in executors.

Executors use daemon cached thread pools for sending metrics and execute tasks.

The thread pool's name is `Executor task launch worker`

When you execute an action that ultimately triggers task execution you should see the following INFO logs:

```
INFO Executor: Running task 0.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 8)
```

`TID` is the task's id being executed in `Executor task launch worker-8`.

You can later see the INFO log:

```
INFO Executor: Finished task 0.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 8). 2082 bytes result sent to driver
```

* Distributed workers
* Responsible for executing link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#tasks[tasks]
* Responsible for storing any data that the user chooses to cache
* Can run many tasks in parallel

A worker requires the additional services (beside the common ones like ...):

* executorActorSystemName
* link:spark-rpc.adoc[RPC Environment] (for Akka only)
* link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc#MapOutputTrackerWorker[MapOutputTrackerWorker]
* link:spark-metrics.adoc[MetricsSystem] with the name `executor`

CAUTION: FIXME How many cores are assigned per executor?

==== [[executor-settings]] Executor Settings

* `spark.executor.cores` - the number of cores for an executor
* `spark.executor.extraClassPath` - a list of URLs representing the user classpath. Each entry is separated by system-dependent path separator, i.e. `:` on Unix/MacOS systems and `;` on Microsoft Windows.
* `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` - extra Java options for executors
* `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath`
* `spark.executor.userClassPathFirst` (default: `false`) controls whether to load classes in user jars before those in Spark jars.
* `spark.executor.heartbeatInterval` (default: `10s`)
* `spark.executor.id`
* `spark.executor.instances` - the number of executors. When greater than `0`, it disables link:spark-dynamic-allocation.adoc[Dynamic Allocation].
* `spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxSize`
* `spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxRetainedFiles`
* `spark.executor.logs.rolling.strategy`
* `spark.executor.logs.rolling.time.interval`
* `spark.executor.memory` (default: `1024` mebibytes) - equivalent to `SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY` (formerly and now deprecated `SPARK_MEM`).
* `spark.executor.port`
* `spark.executor.uri` - equivalent to `SPARK_EXECUTOR_URI`

==== driver-heartbeater - heartbeats and partial metrics for active tasks

`driver-heartbeater` daemon single-thread scheduled pool executor, i.e. `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`, is used for sending executor heartbeats and partial metrics for running tasks back to the driver. They are sent to the driver every <<executor-settings, spark.executor.heartbeatInterval>>.

The structure with the information is an array of `(Long, TaskMetrics)`.

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME

* What's in `taskRunner.task.metrics`?
* What's in `Heartbeat`? Why is `blockManagerId` sent?
* What's in `RpcUtils.makeDriverRef`?
====

It creates an RPC endpoint for receiving RPCs from the driver.

==== [[createExecutorEnv]] SparkEnv.createExecutorEnv

`SparkEnv.createExecutorEnv` creates an Spark environment for an executor.

It uses SparkConf, the executor's identifier, hostname, port, the number of cores, and whether or not it runs in local mode.

For Akka-based RPC Environment (obsolete since Spark 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT), the name of the actor system for an executor is *sparkExecutor*.

=== [[scheduler-backends]] Scheduler Backends

Spark comes with a pluggable backend mechanism called scheduler backend for different modes of scheduling tasks.

A *Scheduler Backend* is the Spark interface to different task scheduling systems, i.e. link:spark-local.adoc#local-backend[Spark local], link:spark-standalone.adoc[Spark Standalone], link:spark-mesos.adoc[Mesos] or link:spark-yarn.adoc[YARN].

Being a scheduler backend assumes a http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos]-like model in which "an application" gets *resource offers* as machines become available and can launch tasks on them.

Scheduler backends can be started and stopped. They can reviveOffers, calculate defaultParallelism, kill tasks, return application attempt id (supported only by `YarnClusterSchedulerBackend`) and URLs for the driver logs.

Q: How does it correspond to jobs?

The default unique identifier for a Spark application is *spark-application-* + the current time millis. The format depends on the scheduler implementation (?)

Spark comes with the following scheduler backends:

* *LocalBackend* that is used in link:spark-local.adoc#local-backend[Spark local mode].
* *CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend*
** *SparkDeploySchedulerBackend* used in link:spark-standalone.adoc#spark-deply-scheduler-backend[Spark Standalone] (and local-cluster - FIXME)
** YarnSchedulerBackend
*** YarnClientSchedulerBackend
*** *YarnClusterSchedulerBackend* used in link:spark-yarn.adoc#yarn-cluster-scheduler-backend[Spark on YARN in cluster mode]
** CoarseMesosSchedulerBackend
** SimrSchedulerBackend
* *MesosSchedulerBackend*

=== [[executor-backends]] Executor Backends

An *Executor Backend* manages a single executor. At startup, it connects to the driver and creates an executor. It then launches and kills tasks. It stops when the driver orders so.

An executor backend acts as a bridge between the driver and an executor, i.e. there are two endpoints.

It asks the driver for the driver's Spark properties

TIP: Enable `INFO` for `org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` to see the inner-workings.

There are the following kinds of executor backends:

* local executor backend
* <<coarse-grained, coarse-grained executor backend>>
** used for YARN and coarse-grained mode in Mesos
* Mesos executor backend

=== [[SparkEnv]] SparkEnv

*SparkEnv* holds all runtime environment objects for a running Spark instance, either link:spark-execution-model.adoc#master[master] or link:spark-execution-model.adoc#worker[worker].

You can access the Spark environment using `SparkEnv.get`.

```
scala> import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark._

scala> SparkEnv.get
res0: org.apache.spark.SparkEnv = org.apache.spark.SparkEnv@2220c5f7
```
