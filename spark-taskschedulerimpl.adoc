== [[TaskSchedulerImpl]] TaskSchedulerImpl - Default TaskScheduler

`TaskSchedulerImpl` is the default implementation of link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract]. It can schedule tasks for multiple types of cluster managers by means of link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[Scheduler Backends].

It uses link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[SchedulableBuilders] that exclusively manage (a pool of) `TaskSetManagers`.

It <<submitTasks, submits tasks>> using link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[SchedulableBuilders].

When a Spark application starts (and an instance of link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext is created]) `TaskSchedulerImpl` with a link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[SchedulerBackend] and link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] are created and soon started.

NOTE: `TaskSchedulerImpl` is a `private[spark]` class with the source code in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala[org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl].

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` or `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl=DEBUG
```
====

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating TaskSchedulerImpl

Creating a `TaskSchedulerImpl` object requires a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext] object, the <<maxTaskFailures, acceptable number of task failures>> (`maxTaskFailures`) and optional <<isLocal, isLocal>> flag (disabled by default, i.e. `false`).

NOTE: There is another `TaskSchedulerImpl` constructor that requires a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext] object only and sets <<maxTaskFailures, maxTaskFailures>> to <<spark.task.maxFailures, spark.task.maxFailures>> or, if `spark.task.maxFailures` is not set, defaults to `4`.

While being created, it initializes <<internal-registries, internal registries>> to their default values.

It then sets link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[schedulingMode] to the value of <<spark.scheduler.mode, spark.scheduler.mode>> setting or `FIFO`.

NOTE: `schedulingMode` is part of link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract].

Failure to set `schedulingMode` results in a `SparkException`:

```
Unrecognized spark.scheduler.mode: [schedulingModeConf]
```

It sets `taskResultGetter` as a <<TaskResultGetter, TaskResultGetter>>.

CAUTION: FIXME Where is `taskResultGetter` used?

=== [[maxTaskFailures]] Acceptable Number of Task Failures (maxTaskFailures attribute)

The acceptable number of task failures (`maxTaskFailures`) can be explicitly defined when <<creating-instance, creating TaskSchedulerImpl instance>> or based on <<spark.task.maxFailures, spark.task.maxFailures>> setting that defaults to 4 failures.

NOTE: It is exclusively used when <<submitTasks, submitting tasks>> through link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager].

=== [[isLocal]] Local vs Non-Local Mode (isLocal attribute)

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[initialization]][[initialize]] TaskSchedulerImpl Initialization (initialize method)

[source, scala]
----
initialize(backend: SchedulerBackend): Unit
----

`initialize` initializes a `TaskSchedulerImpl` object.

.TaskSchedulerImpl initialization
image::images/TaskSchedulerImpl-initialize.png[align="center"]

NOTE: `initialize` is called when link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#createTaskScheduler[SparkContext creates SchedulerBackend and TaskScheduler].

`initialize` saves the reference to link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[SchedulerBackend] (as `backend`) and sets `rootPool` to be an empty-named link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[Pool] with already-initialized `schedulingMode` (while <<creating-instance, creating a TaskSchedulerImpl object>>), `initMinShare` and `initWeight` as `0`.

NOTE: `schedulingMode` and `rootPool` are part of link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract].

It then creates the internal link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[SchedulableBuilder] object (as `schedulableBuilder`) based on `schedulingMode`:

* link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc#FIFOSchedulableBuilder[FIFOSchedulableBuilder] for `FIFO` scheduling mode
* link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc#FairSchedulableBuilder[FairSchedulableBuilder] for `FAIR` scheduling mode

With the `schedulableBuilder` object created, `initialize` requests it to link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc#buildPools[build pools].

CAUTION: FIXME Why are `rootPool` and `schedulableBuilder` created only now? What do they need that it is not available when `TaskSchedulerImpl` is created?

=== [[start]] Starting TaskSchedulerImpl (start method)

When `TaskSchedulerImpl` is started (using `start()` method), it starts the link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[scheduler backend] it manages.

Below is a figure of the method calls in Spark Standalone mode.

.Starting TaskSchedulerImpl in Spark Standalone mode
image::images/taskschedulerimpl-start-standalone.png[align="center"]

TIP: SparkContext starts a TaskScheduler.

It also starts the *task-scheduler-speculation* executor pool. See <<speculative-execution, Speculative Execution of Tasks>>.

=== [[postStartHook]] Post-Start Initialization (using postStartHook)

`postStartHook` is a custom implementation of link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[postStartHook from the TaskScheduler Contract] that waits until a scheduler backend is ready (using the internal blocking <<waitBackendReady, waitBackendReady>>).

NOTE: `postStartHook` is used when link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#initialization[SparkContext is created] (before it is fully created) and link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#implementations[YarnClusterScheduler.postStartHook].

=== [[waitBackendReady]] Waiting Until SchedulerBackend is Ready (waitBackendReady method)

The private `waitBackendReady` method waits until a link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#contract[SchedulerBackend is ready].

It keeps on checking the status every 100 milliseconds until the SchedulerBackend is ready or the link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#stop[SparkContext is stopped].

If the SparkContext happens to be stopped while doing the waiting, a `IllegalStateException` is thrown with the message:

```
Spark context stopped while waiting for backend
```

=== [[stopping]] Stopping TaskSchedulerImpl (stop method)

When `TaskSchedulerImpl` is stopped (using `stop()` method), it does the following:

* Shuts down the internal `task-scheduler-speculation` thread pool executor (used for <<speculative-execution, Speculative execution of tasks>>).
* Stops link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[SchedulerBackend].
* Stops link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#TaskResultGetter[TaskResultGetter].
* Cancels `starvationTimer` timer.

=== [[speculative-execution]] Speculative Execution of Tasks

*Speculative tasks* (also *speculatable tasks* or *task strugglers*) are tasks that run slower than most (FIXME the setting) of the all tasks in a job.

*Speculative execution of tasks* is a health-check procedure that checks for tasks to be *speculated*, i.e. running slower in a stage than the median of all successfully completed tasks in a taskset (FIXME the setting). Such slow tasks will be re-launched in another worker. It will not stop the slow tasks, but run a new copy in parallel.

The thread starts as `TaskSchedulerImpl` starts in link:spark-cluster.adoc[clustered deployment modes] with link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#settings[spark.speculation] enabled. It executes periodically every <<settings, spark.speculation.interval>> after <<settings, spark.speculation.interval>> passes.

When enabled, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Starting speculative execution thread
```

It works as *task-scheduler-speculation* daemon thread pool using `j.u.c.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with core pool size `1`.

The job with speculatable tasks should finish while speculative tasks are running, and it will leave these tasks running - no KILL command yet.

It uses `checkSpeculatableTasks` method that asks `rootPool` to check for speculatable tasks. If there are any, SchedulerBackend is called for link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#reviveOffers[reviveOffers].

CAUTION: FIXME How does Spark handle repeated results of speculative tasks since there are copies launched?

=== [[defaultParallelism]] Default Level of Parallelism

*Default level of parallelism* is a hint for sizing jobs.

`TaskSchedulerImpl` uses link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#defaultParallelism[SchedulerBackend.defaultParallelism()] to calculate the value, i.e. it just passes it along to a scheduler backend.

=== [[submitTasks]] Task Submission (using submitTasks)

link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[Tasks] are submitted for execution as a link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] using `submitTasks`.

.TaskSchedulerImpl.submitTasks
image::images/taskschedulerImpl-submitTasks.png[align="center"]

NOTE: `submitTasks` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract].

NOTE: If there are tasks to launch for missing partitions in a stage, DAGScheduler executes `submitTasks` (see link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#submitMissingTasks[submitMissingTasks for Stage and Job]).

When this method is called, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Adding task set [taskSet.id] with [tasks.length] tasks
```

It creates a new link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] for the given TaskSet `taskSet` and the <<maxTaskFailures, acceptable number of task failures>>.

NOTE: The acceptable number of task failures is specified when a <<creating-instance, TaskSchedulerImpl is created>>.

`taskSetsByStageIdAndAttempt`, i.e. a mapping of stages and another mapping of attempt ids and TaskSetManagers, is checked for conflicting TaskSetManagers, i.e. TaskSetManagers for which the TaskSets are different and TaskSetManager is not a zombie. If there is one, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with the message:

```
more than one active taskSet for stage [stage]: [TaskSet ids]
```

Otherwise, the just-created `TaskSetManager` is link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[added].

When the method is called the first time (`hasReceivedTask` is `false`) in cluster mode, `starvationTimer` is scheduled at fixed rate, i.e. every <<settings, spark.starvation.timeout>> after the first <<settings, spark.starvation.timeout>> passes (`hasReceivedTask` becomes `true`).

Every time the starvation timer thread is executed, it checks whether `hasLaunchedTask` is `false`, and logs the WARNING:

```
WARNING Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient resources
```

Otherwise, the timer thread cancels itself.

It then calls link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#reviveOffers[SchedulerBackend.reviveOffers()].

TIP: Use `dag-scheduler-event-loop` thread to step through the code in a debugger.

=== [[resourceOffers]] Processing Resource Offers (using resourceOffers)

[source, scala]
----
resourceOffers(offers: Seq[WorkerOffer]): Seq[Seq[TaskDescription]]
----

`resourceOffers` method is called by a cluster manager or link:spark-local.adoc#LocalBackend[LocalBackend] (for local mode) to offer free resources available on the executors to run tasks on.

.TaskSchedulerImpl.resourceOffers under the hood
image::images/taskscheduler-resourceOffers.png[align="center"]

A `WorkerOffer` is a 3-tuple with executor id, host, and the number of free cores available.

[source, scala]
----
WorkerOffer(executorId: String, host: String, cores: Int)
----

For each `WorkerOffer` the `resourceOffers` method tracks hosts per executor id (using the internal `executorIdToHost`) and sets `0` as the number of tasks running on the executor if there is no tasks running already (using `executorIdToTaskCount`). It also tracks executor id per host.

WARNING: FIXME BUG? Why is the executor id *not* added to `executorsByHost`?

For the offers with a host that has not been tracked yet (in the internal `executorsByHost` registry) the following occurs:

1. A new entry for the host in the offer is added to the internal `executorsByHost` registry.
2. <<executorAdded, executorAdded>> is called (with the executor id and the host from the offer).
3. `newExecAvail` is enabled (it is later used to inform `TaskSetManagers` about the new executor).

WARNING: FIXME BUG? Why is `executorAdded` called for a new host added? Can't we have more executors on a host? The name of the method is misleading then.

CAUTION: FIXME a picture with `executorAdded` call from TaskSchedulerImpl to DAGScheduler.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is `getRackForHost` important?

It builds a list of tasks (using `TaskDescription`) to assign to each worker.

link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[rootPool.getSortedTaskSetQueue] is called to build a sorted `TaskSetManager` queue.

NOTE: `rootPool` belongs to the link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract] and is exclusively managed by link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc[SchedulableBuilders] (that  link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulablebuilders.adoc#addTaskSetManager[add Schedulables to the rootPool] which are link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManagers] or link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[pools of TaskSetManagers]).

For every `TaskSetManager` in the `TaskSetManager` sorted queue, the following DEBUG message is printed out to the logs:

```
DEBUG TaskSchedulerImpl: parentName: [taskSet.parent.name], name: [taskSet.name], runningTasks: [taskSet.runningTasks]
```

NOTE: The internal `rootPool` is configured while <<initialize, TaskSchedulerImpl is being initialized>>.

While iterating over the sorted `TaskSetManager` queue, if a new host was added to the pool, all `TaskSetManagers` are link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#executorAdded[informed about the new executor].

WARNING: FIXME BUG? Why is the name `newExecAvail` since it's called for a new host added? Can't we have more executors on a host? The name of the method could be misleading.

For each taskset in `sortedTaskSets`, different locality preferences are checked...FIXME

Check whether the number of cores in an offer is more than the number of cores needed for a task (using <<settings, spark.task.cpus>>).

When `resourceOffers` managed to launch a task, the internal field `hasLaunchedTask` becomes `true` (that effectively means what the name says _"There were executors and I managed to launch a task"_).

=== [[TaskResultGetter]] TaskResultGetter

`TaskResultGetter` is a helper class for <<statusUpdate, TaskSchedulerImpl.statusUpdate>>. It _asynchronously_ fetches the task results of tasks that have finished successfully (using <<enqueueSuccessfulTask, enqueueSuccessfulTask>>) or fetches the reasons of failures for failed tasks (using <<enqueueFailedTask, enqueueFailedTask>>). It then sends the "results" back to `TaskSchedulerImpl`.

CAUTION: FIXME Image with the dependencies

TIP: Consult link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc#states[Task States] in Tasks to learn about the different task states.

NOTE: The only instance of `TaskResultGetter` is created while <<creating-instance, TaskSchedulerImpl is being created>> (as `taskResultGetter`). It requires a `SparkEnv` and `TaskSchedulerImpl`. It is stopped when `TaskSchedulerImpl` stops.

`TaskResultGetter` offers the following methods:

* <<enqueueSuccessfulTask, enqueueSuccessfulTask>>
* <<enqueueFailedTask, enqueueFailedTask>>

The methods use the internal (daemon thread) thread pool *task-result-getter* (as `getTaskResultExecutor`) with <<settings, spark.resultGetter.threads>> so they can be executed asynchronously.

==== [[enqueueSuccessfulTask]] TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask

`enqueueSuccessfulTask(taskSetManager: TaskSetManager, tid: Long, serializedData: ByteBuffer)` starts by deserializing `TaskResult` (from `serializedData` using the global link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#closureSerializer[closure Serializer]).

If the result is `DirectTaskResult`, the method checks `taskSetManager.canFetchMoreResults(serializedData.limit())` and possibly quits. If not, it deserializes the result (using `SparkEnv.serializer`).

CAUTION: FIXME Review `taskSetManager.canFetchMoreResults(serializedData.limit())`.

If the result is `IndirectTaskResult`, the method checks `taskSetManager.canFetchMoreResults(size)` and possibly removes the block id (using `SparkEnv.blockManager.master.removeBlock(blockId)`) and quits. If not, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Fetching indirect task result for TID [tid]
```

`scheduler.handleTaskGettingResult(taskSetManager, tid)` gets called. And `sparkEnv.blockManager.getRemoteBytes(blockId)`.

Failure in getting task result from BlockManager results in calling <<handleFailedTask, TaskSchedulerImpl.handleFailedTask(taskSetManager, tid, TaskState.FINISHED, TaskResultLost)>> and quit.

The task result is deserialized to `DirectTaskResult` (using the global link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#closureSerializer[closure Serializer]) and `sparkEnv.blockManager.master.removeBlock(blockId)` is called afterwards.

`TaskSchedulerImpl.handleSuccessfulTask(taskSetManager, tid, result)` is called.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `TaskSchedulerImpl.handleSuccessfulTask` doing?

Any `ClassNotFoundException` or non fatal exceptions lead to link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#aborting-taskset[TaskSetManager.abort].

==== [[enqueueFailedTask]] TaskResultGetter.enqueueFailedTask

`enqueueFailedTask(taskSetManager: TaskSetManager, tid: Long, taskState: TaskState, serializedData: ByteBuffer)` checks whether `serializedData` contains any data and if it does it deserializes it to a `TaskEndReason` (using the global link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#closureSerializer[closure Serializer]).

Either `UnknownReason` or the deserialized instance is passed on to <<handleFailedTask, TaskSchedulerImpl.handleFailedTask>> as the reason of the failure.

Any `ClassNotFoundException` leads to printing out the ERROR message to the logs:

```
ERROR Could not deserialize TaskEndReason: ClassNotFound with classloader [loader]
```

=== [[statusUpdate]] TaskSchedulerImpl.statusUpdate

`statusUpdate(tid: Long, state: TaskState, serializedData: ByteBuffer)` is called by link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[scheduler backends] to inform about task state changes (see link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc#states[Task States] in Tasks).

CAUTION: FIXME image with scheduler backends calling `TaskSchedulerImpl.statusUpdate`.

It is called by:

* link:spark-scheduler-backends-coarse-grained.adoc[CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend] when `StatusUpdate(executorId, taskId, state, data)` comes.
* link:spark-mesos.adoc#MesosSchedulerBackend[MesosSchedulerBackend] when `org.apache.mesos.Scheduler.statusUpdate` is called.
* link:spark-local.adoc#LocalEndpoint[LocalEndpoint] when `StatusUpdate(taskId, state, serializedData)` comes.

When `statusUpdate` starts, it checks the current state of the task and act accordingly.

If a task became `TaskState.LOST` and there is still an executor assigned for the task (it seems it may not given the check), the executor is marked as lost (or sometimes called failed). The executor is later announced as such using `DAGScheduler.executorLost` with link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#reviveOffers[SchedulerBackend.reviveOffers()] being called afterwards.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#reviveOffers[SchedulerBackend.reviveOffers()] called only for lost executors?

CAUTION: FIXME Review `TaskSchedulerImpl.removeExecutor`

The method looks up the link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] for the task (using `taskIdToTaskSetManager`).

When the TaskSetManager is found and the task is in finished state, the task is removed from the internal data structures, i.e. `taskIdToTaskSetManager` and `taskIdToExecutorId`, and the number of currently running tasks for the executor(s) is decremented (using `executorIdToTaskCount`).

For a `FINISHED` task, link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet.removeRunningTask] is called and then <<TaskResultGetter, TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask>>.

For a task in `FAILED`, `KILLED`, or `LOST` state, link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet.removeRunningTask] is called (as for the `FINISHED` state) and then <<TaskResultGetter,TaskResultGetter.enqueueFailedTask>>.

If the TaskSetManager could not be found, the following ERROR shows in the logs:

```
ERROR Ignoring update with state [state] for TID [tid] because its task set is gone (this is likely the result of receiving duplicate task finished status updates)
```

=== [[handleFailedTask]] TaskSchedulerImpl.handleFailedTask

`TaskSchedulerImpl.handleFailedTask(taskSetManager: TaskSetManager, tid: Long, taskState: TaskState, reason: TaskEndReason)` is called when <<enqueueSuccessfulTask, TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask>> failed to fetch bytes from BlockManager or as part of <<enqueueFailedTask, TaskResultGetter.enqueueFailedTask>>.

Either way there is an error related to task execution.

It calls link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#handleFailedTask[TaskSetManager.handleFailedTask].

If link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#zombie-state[the TaskSetManager is not a zombie] and the task's state is not `KILLED`, link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc#reviveOffers[SchedulerBackend.reviveOffers] is called.

=== [[taskSetFinished]] TaskSchedulerImpl.taskSetFinished

`taskSetFinished(manager: TaskSetManager)` method is called to inform TaskSchedulerImpl that all tasks in a TaskSetManager have finished execution.

.TaskSchedulerImpl.taskSetFinished is called when all tasks are finished
image::images/taskschedulerimpl-tasksetmanager-tasksetfinished.png[align="center"]

NOTE: `taskSetFinished` is called by TaskSetManager at the very end of link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc#handleFailedTask[TaskSetManager.handleSuccessfulTask].

`taskSetsByStageIdAndAttempt` internal mapping is queried by stage id (using `manager.taskSet.stageId`) for the corresponding TaskSets (TaskSetManagers in fact) to remove the currently-finished stage attempt (using `manager.taskSet.stageAttemptId`) and if it was the only attempt, the stage id is completely removed from `taskSetsByStageIdAndAttempt`.

NOTE: A TaskSetManager owns a TaskSet that corresponds to a stage.

`Pool.removeSchedulable(manager)` is called for the `parent` of the TaskSetManager.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Removed TaskSet [manager.taskSet.id], whose tasks have all completed, from pool [manager.parent.name]
```

=== [[executorAdded]] TaskSchedulerImpl.executorAdded

[source, scala]
----
executorAdded(execId: String, host: String)
----

`executorAdded` method simply passes the notification on to the `DAGScheduler` (using link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#executorAdded[DAGScheduler.executorAdded])

CAUTION: FIXME Image with a call from TaskSchedulerImpl to DAGScheduler, please.

=== [[internal-registries]] Internal Registries

CAUTION: FIXME How/where are these mappings used?

`TaskSchedulerImpl` tracks the following information in its internal data structures:

* the number of link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks] already scheduled for execution (`nextTaskId`).
* link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSets] by stage and attempt ids (`taskSetsByStageIdAndAttempt`)
* link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks] to their link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManagers] (`taskIdToTaskSetManager`)
* link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks] to link:spark-executor.adoc[executors] (`taskIdToExecutorId`)
* the number of link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks] running per link:spark-executor.adoc[executor] (`executorIdToTaskCount`)
* the set of link:spark-executor.adoc[executors] on each host (`executorsByHost`)
* the set of hosts per rack (`hostsByRack`)
* executor ids to corresponding host (`executorIdToHost`).

=== [[settings]] Settings

[[spark.task.maxFailures]]
* `spark.task.maxFailures` (default: `4` for link:spark-cluster.adoc[cluster mode] and `1` for link:spark-local.adoc[local] except link:spark-local.adoc[local-with-retries]) - The number of individual task failures before giving up on the entire link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] and the job afterwards.
+
It is used in `TaskSchedulerImpl` to initialize a link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager].

[[spark.task.cpus]]
* `spark.task.cpus` (default: `1`) - how many CPUs to request per task in a SparkContext. You cannot have different number of CPUs per task in a single SparkContext.

[[spark.scheduler.mode]]
* `spark.scheduler.mode` (default: `FIFO`) is a case-insensitive `FAIR`, `FIFO`, or `NONE`. See link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[SchedulingMode].
* `spark.speculation.interval` (default: `100ms`) - how often to check for speculative tasks.
* `spark.starvation.timeout` (default: `15s`) - Threshold above which Spark warns a user that an initial TaskSet may be starved.

* `spark.resultGetter.threads` (default: `4`) - the number of threads for <<TaskResultGetter, TaskResultGetter>>.
