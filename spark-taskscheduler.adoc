== Task Schedulers

A *Task Scheduler* schedules link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks] for a link:spark-anatomy-spark-application.adoc[single Spark application] according to <<scheduling-mode, scheduling mode>> (aka *order task policy*).

.TaskScheduler works for a single SparkContext
image::images/sparkstandalone-sparkcontext-taskscheduler-schedulerbackend.png[align="center"]

A TaskScheduler gets sets of tasks (as link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSets]) submitted to it from the link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] for each stage, and is responsible for sending the tasks to the cluster, running them, retrying if there are failures, and mitigating stragglers.

=== [[contract]] TaskScheduler Contract

NOTE: `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskScheduler` is a `private[spark]` Scala trait in Spark.

Every task scheduler has to offer the following services:

* Return `Pool` (using `rootPool`)
* Return `SchedulingMode` (using `schedulingMode`)
* Can be started (using `start()`) and stopped (using `stop()`)
* (optionally) `postStartHook()` if needed for additional post-start initialization. It does nothing by default. It is called at the very end of link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#initialization[SparkContext's initialization].
* `submitTasks(taskSet: TaskSet)`
* `cancelTasks(stageId: Int, interruptThread: Boolean)` to cancel all tasks in a stage.
* `setDAGScheduler(dagScheduler: DAGScheduler)` to set custom link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler].
* Return the default level of parallelism (using `defaultParallelism()`)
* `executorHeartbeatReceived`
* (optionally) Return an application id for the current job (using `applicationId()`). It returns `spark-application-[System.currentTimeMillis]` by default.
* Handle executor lost events (using `executorLost(executorId: String, reason: ExecutorLossReason)`)
* Return an application attempt ID associated with the job (using `applicationAttemptId`)

CAUTION: FIXME Have an exercise to create a SchedulerBackend.

=== Available Implementations

Spark comes with the following task schedulers:

* link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc[TaskSchedulerImpl]
* https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/YarnScheduler.scala[YarnScheduler] for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN]
* https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/YarnClusterScheduler.scala[YarnClusterScheduler] for link:spark-yarn.adoc[Spark on YARN]

A TaskScheduler emits events to the DAGScheduler.

.TaskScheduler uses SchedulerBackend for different clusters

DAGScheduler uses <<submitTasks, submitTasks() operation >> to submit a TaskSet to Task Scheduler and can cancel tasks in a stage.
