== Task Scheduler

*Tasks* are individual units of work, each sent to one machine.

*Task Scheduler* schedules tasks for a single link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext].

.TaskScheduler works for a single SparkContext

Task schedulers get sets of tasks submitted to them from the link:spark-scheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] for each stage, and are responsible for sending the tasks to the cluster, running them, retrying if there are failures, and mitigating stragglers.

They return events to the DAGScheduler.

Task Scheduler is currently implemented exclusively by `TaskSchedulerImpl`.

Task Scheduler can work in one of two scheduling modes - *FAIR* and *FIFO* - that determine policy to order tasks across a Schedulable's sub-queues. *NONE* means no sub-queues.

* *FIFO* - no pools; one root pool with TaskSetManagers; lower priority gets Schedulable sooner or earlier stage wins.
* *FAIR* - more advanced

DAGScheduler uses <<submitTasks, submitTasks() operation >> to submit a TaskSet to Task Scheduler and can cancel tasks in a stage.

=== [[taskset]] TaskSet

*TaskSet* is a set of tasks that belong to a single stage and an attempt. The pair of a stage and an attempt uniquely describes a TaskSet. TaskSet represents missing partitions of a stage.

TaskSet has *priority* and *properties*. Priority is used in FIFO scheduling mode. Properties are the first job in a stage's properties.

A TaskSet contains a fully-independent sequence of tasks that can run right away based on the data that is already on the cluster, e.g. map output files from previous stages, though it may fail if this data becomes unavailable.

TaskSet can be <<submitTasks, submitted>>, i.e. started.

=== TaskSetManager

*TaskSetManager* manages execution of the tasks in a TaskSet. It schedules the tasks and keeps track of their execution, retries them upon failure (up to <<settings, spark.task.maxFailures>>), and handles locality-aware scheduling for this TaskSet via delay scheduling.

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME

1. When is this class called? By whom?
====

For each submitted <<taskset, TaskSet>>, a new *TaskSetManager* is created. A TaskSetManager completely and exclusively owns a TaskSet submitted for execution.

.TaskSetManager owns TaskSet
image::diagrams/tasksetmanager-taskset.png[align="center"]

It is an `Schedulable` that works with `TaskSchedulerImpl`. As an `Schedulable` it has a *priority* property (among others).

[TIP]
====
Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties` to see what happens under the covers of `TaskSetManager`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager=DEBUG
```

==== [[tasksetmanager-settings]] Settings

* `spark.scheduler.executorTaskBlacklistTime` (default: `0L`) - time interval to pass after which a task can be re-launched on an executor where it has just failed. It can prevent repeated task failures.
* `spark.speculation` (default: `false`)
* `spark.speculation.interval` (default: `100ms`)
* `spark.speculation.quantile` (default: `0.75`) - the percentage of tasks that has not finished yet.
* `spark.speculation.multiplier` (default: `1.5`)

==== Task retries and spark.task.maxFailures

CAUTION: FIXME Review `handleFailedTask`

When you start Spark program you set up <<settings, spark.task.maxFailures>> for the number of failures that are acceptable until TaskSetManager gives up and marks a job failed.

In Spark shell with local master, `spark.task.maxFailures` is fixed to `1` and you need to use link:spark-local.adoc[local-with-failures master] to change it to some other value.

In the following example, you are going to execute a job with two partitions and keep one failing at all times (by throwing an exception). The aim is to learn the behavior of retrying task execution in a stage in TaskSet. You will only look at a single task execution, namely `0.0`.

```

==== [[zombie-state]] Zombie state

TaskSetManager enters *zombie* state when at least one attempt of each task has completed successfully, or if the task set is aborted, e.g. because it was killed. In this zombie state, no more tasks should be launched for this TaskSetManager.

TaskSetManager remains in the zombie state until all tasks have finished running, i.e. to continue to track and account for the running tasks.

=== TaskSet's priority field and FIFO scheduling

A TaskSet has `priority` field that turns into the *priority* field's value of TaskSetManager (which is a Schedulable).

The `priority` field is used in `FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm` in which equal priorities give stages an advantage (not to say _priority_).

`FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm` is only used for `FIFO` scheduling mode in a `Pool` which is a Schedulable collection of `Schedulable`'s.

Effectively, the `priority` field is the job's id of the first job this stage was part of (for FIFO scheduling).

=== [[speculative-execution]] Speculative execution of tasks

*Speculative tasks* (also *speculatable tasks* or *task strugglers*) are tasks that run slower than most of the all tasks in a job.

*Speculative execution of tasks* is a health-check procedure that checks for tasks to be *speculated*, i.e. running slower in a stage than the median of all successfully completed tasks in a taskset. Such slow tasks will be re-launched in another worker. It will not stop the slow tasks, but run a new copy in parallel.

It is executed periodically by the TaskScheduler for link:spark-clusters.adoc[clustered deployment modes], when <<tasksetmanager-settings, spark.speculation>> is enabled (`true`).

With `spark.speculation` enabled, the following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO Starting speculative execution thread
```

It is scheduled using *task-scheduler-speculation* daemon thread pool using `j.u.c.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with core pool size `1`.

It is executed for <<zombie-state,non-zombie TaskSetManagers>> with more than one task to execute.

The process computes <<tasksetmanager-settings, spark.speculation.quantile>> of all the tasks and checks whether the number is greater than the number of tasks completed successfully.

You can find the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Checking for speculative tasks: minFinished =
```

It then computes the median duration of all the completed task length threshold for speculation to have it multiplied by <<tasksetmanager-settings, spark.speculation.multiplier>>. It has to be at least `100`.

In the logs at DEBUG level:

```
DEBUG Task length threshold for speculation:
```

For each active task for which there is only one copy running and the task takes more than the threshold, it gets marked as *speculatable*.

In the logs at INFO level:

```
INFO Marking task %d in stage %s (on %s) as speculatable because it ran more than %.0f ms
```

The job with speculatable tasks should finish while speculative tasks are running, and it will leave these tasks running - no KILL command yet.

1. How does Spark handle repeated results of speculative tasks since there are copies launched?

=== [[submitTasks]] submitTasks

Tasks are submitted for execution using `submitTasks(taskSet: TaskSet)`.

You should see the following INFO in the logs:

```
INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Adding task set 1.0 with 4 tasks
```

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.task.maxFailures` (default: `4` for link:spark-cluster.adoc[cluster mode] and `1` for link:spark-local.adoc[local] except link:spark-local.adoc[local-with-failures]) - The number of individual task failures before giving up on the entire TaskSet and then the job.
+
Internally, it is used in `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl` to initialize `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager`.
* `spark.speculation.interval` (default: `100ms`)
* `spark.task.cpus` (default: `1`) - how many CPUs to request per task.
* `spark.scheduler.mode` (default: `FIFO`)
