== [[JoinSelection]] JoinSelection Execution Planning Strategy

`JoinSelection` is an link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy.adoc[execution planning strategy] of link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner].

When applied to a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan], its processing varies per join type.

=== [[ExtractEquiJoinKeys]] ExtractEquiJoinKeys

`ExtractEquiJoinKeys` is a pattern used to destructure a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan-Join.adoc[Join] into a tuple of `(JoinType, Seq[Expression], Seq[Expression], Option[Expression], LogicalPlan, LogicalPlan)`.

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[canBuildRight]] `canBuildRight` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
canBuildRight(joinType: JoinType): Boolean
----

`canBuildRight` is a predicate that is positive (i.e. `true`) for link:spark-sql-joins.adoc[joins] that are:

* CROSS, INNER, LEFT ANTI, LEFT OUTER, LEFT SEMI or Existence

Otherwise, `canBuildRight` is negative (i.e. `false`).

=== [[canBroadcast]] Checking If Logical Plan Can Be Broadcast -- `canBroadcast` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
canBroadcast(plan: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`canBroadcast` is a predicate that is positive (i.e. `true`) for link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical operators] with statistics that can be broadcast and of non-negative size that is however less than link:spark-sql-settings.adoc#spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold[spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold].
