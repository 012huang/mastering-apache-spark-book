== [[TorrentBroadcastFactory]] TorrentBroadcastFactory

`TorrentBroadcastFactory` is a link:spark-BroadcastFactory.adoc[BroadcastFactory] of link:spark-TorrentBroadcast.adoc[TorrentBroadcast]s, i.e. BitTorrent-like link:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast variables].

NOTE: `TorrentBroadcastFactory` is the one and only implementation of link:spark-BroadcastFactory.adoc[BroadcastFactory].

`newBroadcast` method creates a `TorrentBroadcast` (passing in the input `value_` and `id` and ignoring the `isLocal` parameter).

NOTE: `newBroadcast` is executed when link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc#newBroadcast[`BroadcastManager` is requested to create a new broadcast variable].

[[initialize]][[stop]]
`initialize` and `stop` do nothing.

`unbroadcast` link:spark-TorrentBroadcast.adoc#unpersist[removes all the persisted state associated with the torrent broadcast with the given ID].
