== Accumulators in Spark

TIP: Read http://people.apache.org/~pwendell/spark-nightly/spark-master-docs/latest/programming-guide.html#accumulators-a-nameaccumlinka[the latest documentation about accumulators] before looking for anything useful here.

Each task creates its own local accumulator.

Noticed on the user@spark mailing list that using an external key-value store (like HBase, Redis, Cassandra) and performing lookups/updates inside of your mappers (creating a connection within a link:spark-rdd-transformations.adoc#mapPartitions[mapPartitions] code block to avoid the connection setup/teardown overhead) might be a better solution.

If hbase is used as the external key value store, atomicity is guaranteed
