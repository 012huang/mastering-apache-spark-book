== [[AccumulatorV2]] Accumulators

TIP: Read the official documentation about http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#accumulators[Accumulators]. This document is not ready for prime time yet.

*Accumulators* are variables that are "added" to through an associative and commutative "add" operation. They can be used safely and efficiently in parallel and distributed Spark computations. Accumulators are hence a solid foundation for distributed counters and sums.

You can create built-in accumulators for link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-accumulators[longs, doubles, or collections] or register custom accumulators using the link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#register[SparkContext.register] methods. You can create accumulators with or without a name, but only <<named, named accumulators>> are displayed in link:spark-webui-StagePage.adoc#accumulators[web UI] (under Stages tab for a given stage).

Accumulator are write-only variables for workers. They can be added to by workers and read by the driver only.

```
worker1: accumulator.add(incByWorker1)
worker2: accumulator.add(incByWorker2)

driver:  println(accumulator.value)
```

Accumulators are not thread-safe and they do not really have to -- the link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#updateAccumulators[DAGScheduler.updateAccumulators] method that the driver uses to update the values of accumulators after a task completes (successfully or with a failure) is only executed on a link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#eventProcessLoop[single thread that runs scheduling loop]. Beside that, they are write-only data structures for workers that have their own local accumulator reference whereas accessing the value of an accumulator is only allowed by the driver.

Accumulators are serializable so they can safely be referenced in the code executed on workers and then safely send over the wire for execution.

[source, scala]
----
val counter = sc.longAccumulator("counter")
sc.parallelize(1 to 9).foreach(x => counter.add(x))
----

Internally, link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#longAccumulator[longAccumulator], link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#doubleAccumulator[doubleAccumulator], and link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#collectionAccumulator[collectionAccumulator] methods create the built-in typed accumulators and call link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#register[SparkContext.register].

<<AccumulatorV2, AccumulatorV2>> class and register it to link:spark-service-contextcleaner.adoc[ContextCleaner] for cleanup (using link:spark-service-contextcleaner.adoc#registerAccumulatorForCleanup[registerAccumulatorForCleanup] method).

=== [[AccumulatorV2]] AccumulatorV2

[source, scala]
----
abstract class AccumulatorV2[IN, OUT]
----

`AccumulatorV2` parameterized class represents an accumulator that accumulates `IN` values to produce `OUT` result.

==== [[register]] Registering Accumulator (register method)

[source, scala]
----
register(
  sc: SparkContext,
  name: Option[String] = None,
  countFailedValues: Boolean = false): Unit
----

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[named]] Named Accumulators

An accumulator can have an optional name that you can specify when link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-accumulators[creating an accumulator].

[source, scala]
----
val counter = sc.longAccumulator("counter")
----

=== [[AccumulableInfo]] AccumulableInfo

`AccumulableInfo` contains information about a task's local updates to an <<Accumulable, Accumulable>>.

* `id` of the accumulator
* optional `name` of the accumulator
* optional partial `update` to the accumulator from a task
* `value`
* whether or not it is `internal`
* whether or not to `countFailedValues` to the final value of the accumulator for failed tasks
* optional `metadata`

=== When are Accumulators Updated?

=== [[examples]] Examples

==== [[example-distributed-counter]] Example: Distributed Counter

Imagine you are requested to write a distributed counter. What do you think about the following solutions? What are the pros and cons of using it?

[source, scala]
----
val ints = sc.parallelize(0 to 9, 3)

var counter = 0
ints.foreach { n =>
  println(s"int: $n")
  counter = counter + 1
}
println(s"The number of elements is $counter")
----

How would you go about doing the calculation using accumulators?

==== [[example1]] Example: Using Accumulators in Transformations and Guarantee Exactly-Once Update

CAUTION: FIXME Code with failing transformations (tasks) that update accumulator (`Map`) with `TaskContext` info.

==== [[example2]] Example: Custom Accumulator

CAUTION: FIXME Improve the earlier example

==== [[example3]] Example: Distributed Stopwatch

NOTE: This is _almost_ a raw copy of org.apache.spark.ml.util.DistributedStopwatch.

[source, scala]
----
class DistributedStopwatch(sc: SparkContext, val name: String) {

  val elapsedTime: Accumulator[Long] = sc.accumulator(0L, s"DistributedStopwatch($name)")

  override def elapsed(): Long = elapsedTime.value

  override protected def add(duration: Long): Unit = {
    elapsedTime += duration
  }
}
