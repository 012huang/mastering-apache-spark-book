== RDD shuffling

* Shuffling is a process of link:spark-rdd-partitions.adoc[repartitioning] data that may or may not cause sending it over network.

* Using `repartition(numPartitions: Int)(implicit ord: Ordering[T] = null)` or `coalesce(numPartitions: Int, shuffle: Boolean = false)(implicit ord: Ordering[T] = null)` you can influence the number of the partitions of an RDD. They may or may not cause `shuffle` to occur.
