== RDD shuffling

* Shuffling is a process of link:spark-rdd-partitions.adoc[repartitioning] data that very often causes sending it over network.

* Avoid `groupByKey` and use `reduceByKey` or `combineByKey` instead.
** `groupByKey` shuffles all the data, which is slow.
** `reduceByKey` shuffles only the results of sub-aggregations in each partition of the data.

* Using `repartition(numPartitions: Int)(implicit ord: Ordering[T] = null)` or `coalesce(numPartitions: Int, shuffle: Boolean = false)(implicit ord: Ordering[T] = null)` you can influence the number of the partitions of an RDD. They may or may not cause `shuffle` to occur.
