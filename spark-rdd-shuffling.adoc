== RDD shuffling

*Shuffling* is a process of link:spark-rdd-partitions.adoc[repartitioning] (redistribute) data that very often causes moving it across network.

TIP: Avoid shuffling at all cost. Think about ways to leverage existing partitions. Leverage partial aggregation to reduce data transfer.

By default, shuffling doesn't change the number of partitions.

* Avoid `groupByKey` and use `reduceByKey` or `combineByKey` instead.
** `groupByKey` shuffles all the data, which is slow.
** `reduceByKey` shuffles only the results of sub-aggregations in each partition of the data.
