== StreamExecution

`StreamExecution` manages execution of a streaming query for a `SQLContext` and a `Sink`. It requires a link:spark-sql-logical-plan.adoc[LogicalPlan] to know the `Source` objects from which records are periodically pulled down.

It starts an internal thread (`microBatchThread`) to periodically (every 10 milliseconds) poll for new records in the sources and create a batch.

NOTE: The time between batches - 10 milliseconds - is fixed (i.e. not configurable).

`StreamExecution` can be in three states:

* `INITIALIZED` when the instance was created.
* `ACTIVE` when batches are pulled from the sources.
* `TERMINATED` when batches were successfully processed or the query stopped.
