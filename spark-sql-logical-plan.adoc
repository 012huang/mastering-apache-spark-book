== [[LogicalPlan]] Logical Plan

CAUTION: FIXME

`LogicalPlan` abstract class is a custom link:spark-sql-query-plan.adoc[QueryPlan].

It can be *analyzed* or not, i.e. it has already been gone through analysis and verification.

`LogicalPlan` knows the size of objects that are results of SQL operators, like `join` through `Statistics` object.

`LogicalPlan` knows the maximum number of rows it can compute.

`LogicalPlan` can be *resolved*, i.e. ...TK

=== [[Join]] Join Logical Plan

`Join` is a `LogicalPlan` that acts on two `LogicalPlan` objects. It has a join type and an optional expression for the join.

The following is a list of join types:

* INNER
* LEFT OUTER
* RIGHT OUTER
* FULL OUTER
* LEFT SEMI
* NATURAL
