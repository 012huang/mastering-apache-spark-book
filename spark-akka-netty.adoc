== Spark, Akka and Netty

From http://stackoverflow.com/a/23333955/1305344[How does Spark use Netty?]:

> Spark uses Akka Actor for RPC and messaging, which in turn uses Netty.
>
> Also, for moving bulk data, Netty is used.
>
> * For shuffle data, Netty can be optionally used. By default, NIO is directly used to do transfer shuffle data.
> * For broadcast data (driver-to-all-worker data transfer), Jetty is used by default.
