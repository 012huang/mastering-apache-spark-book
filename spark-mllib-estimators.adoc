== Estimators

An *estimator* takes a `DataFrame` and parameters (as `ParamMap`) and fits a model. It is a function that maps a `DataFrame` into a `Model` that takes a `DataFrame`, trains on it and produces a `Model`.

CAUTION: FIXME What does _fitting a model_ mean?

Estimators are instances of http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.ml.Estimator[org.apache.spark.ml.Estimator] abstract class that comes with `fit` method (with `M` being a `PredictionModel`):

[source, scala]
----
fit(dataset: DataFrame): M
----

A `Estimator` is a link:spark-mllib-pipelines.adoc#PipelineStage[PipelineStage] (so it can be a part of a link:spark-mllib-pipelines.adoc#Pipeline[Pipeline]).

The direct specialized extensions of the `Estimator` abstract class are:

* <<Predictor, Predictor>>

==== [[Predictor]] Predictors

CAUTION: FIXME

A `Predictor` is an link:spark-mllib-pipelines.adoc#Estimator[Estimator] for a `PredictionModel`.
