== Mastering Apache Spark book

This is the ultimate place of https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[Jacek Laskowski] to collect all the goodies that help me reach the highest level of mastery in http://spark.apache.org/[Apache Spark].

It _may_ become a book one day, but surely is going to serve as *the study material* for my upcoming videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to know it early.

Expect text and code snippets from http://spark.apache.org/community.html[Spark's mailing lists], http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/[the official documentation of Apache Spark], http://stackoverflow.com/tags/apache-spark/info[StackOverflow], blog posts, press releases, YouTube/Vimeo videos, http://www.quora.com/Apache-Spark[Quora], etc.
