== Mastering Apache Spark book

I'm https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski[a technical evangelist for Apache Spark at DeepSense.io] and this "book" serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using http://spark.apache.org/[Apache Spark] to design and develop a product at http://deepsense.io/[DeepSense.io] with all the goodies that has been helping the team reach the highest level of mastery in Spark.

It _may_ become a book one day, but surely is going to serve as *the study material* for my upcoming videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to know it early.

Expect text and code snippets from http://spark.apache.org/community.html[Spark's mailing lists], http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/[the official documentation of Apache Spark], http://stackoverflow.com/tags/apache-spark/info[StackOverflow], blog posts, http://search.oreilly.com/?q=learning+spark[books from O'Reilly], press releases, YouTube/Vimeo videos, http://www.quora.com/Apache-Spark[Quora], etc.
