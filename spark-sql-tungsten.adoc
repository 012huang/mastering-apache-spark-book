== Project Tungsten

* code generation
* memory management

*Tungsten* uses `sun.misc.unsafe` API for direct memory access that aims at bypassing the JVM in order to avoid garbage collection.

Tungsten does code generation, i.e. generates JVM bytecode on the fly, to access Tungsten-managed memory structures that gives a very fast access.
