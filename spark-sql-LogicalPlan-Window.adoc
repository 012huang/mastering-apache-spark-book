== [[Window]] Window Unary Logical Operator

`Window` is a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#UnaryNode[unary logical operator] that is created for a collection of `NamedExpressions` (for windows), a collection of `Expressions` (for partitions), a collection of `SortOrder` (for sorting) and a child logical plan.

The `output` (collection of link:spark-sql-catalyst-Attribute.adoc[Attributes]) is the child's attributes and the window's.

`Window` logical plan is a subject of pruning unnecessary window expressions in link:spark-sql-Optimizer-ColumnPruning.adoc[ColumnPruning] rule and pushing filter operators in link:spark-sql-Optimizer-PushDownPredicate.adoc[PushDownPredicate] rule.
