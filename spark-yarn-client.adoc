== Client

`Client` belongs to `org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn` package.

Depending on the deploy mode in use (`spark.submit.deployMode`) it calls link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc[org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.ApplicationMaster] or link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#ExecutorLauncher[org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.ExecutorLauncher] by their class names (so the instantiation is implicit and dynamic, i.e. happens at runtime).
