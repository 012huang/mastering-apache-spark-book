== YarnAllocator -- Container Allocator

`YarnAllocator` requests containers (for executors) from the YARN ResourceManager and kills them when link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc[ApplicationMaster] decides so.

It uses YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html[AMRMClient] API.

It is used in link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc[ApplicationMaster] (via an internal `allocator`) and is created when link:spark-yarn-yarnrmclient.adoc#register[`YarnRMClient` registers an application master with the ResourceManager].

.ApplicationMaster uses YarnAllocator (via allocator attribute)

It is used when link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#registerAM[`ApplicationMaster` is registered to the YARN ResourceManager].

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating YarnAllocator Instance

When `YarnAllocator` is created, it sets the `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.RackResolver` logger to `WARN` (unless set to some log level already).

It creates an empty <<releasedContainers, releasedContainers>> and sets the internal `numExecutorsRunning` variable to `0`.

It sets the internal `executorIdCounter` counter to the link:spark-yarn-cluster-YarnSchedulerEndpoint.adoc#RetrieveLastAllocatedExecutorId[last allocated executor id].

It creates an empty <<failedExecutorsTimeStamps, failedExecutorsTimeStamps>> queue.

It sets the internal `executorFailuresValidityInterval` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval[spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval].

It sets the internal `targetNumExecutors` counter to link:spark-yarn-YarnSparkHadoopUtil.adoc#getInitialTargetExecutorNumber[YarnSparkHadoopUtil.getInitialTargetExecutorNumber(sparkConf)].

CAUTION: FIXME `YarnSparkHadoopUtil.getInitialTargetExecutorNumber(sparkConf)`?

It creates an empty <<pendingLossReasonRequests, pendingLossReasonRequests>> collection of...FIXME

It creates an empty <<releasedExecutorLossReasons, releasedExecutorLossReasons>> collection of...FIXME

It creates an empty <<executorIdToContainer, executorIdToContainer>> collection of...FIXME

It sets the internal `numUnexpectedContainerRelease` counter to `0L`.

It creates an empty <<containerIdToExecutorId, containerIdToExecutorId>> collection of...FIXME

It sets the internal `executorMemory` to link:spark-executor.adoc#spark.executor.memory[spark.executor.memory].

It sets the internal `memoryOverhead` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead[spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead]. If unavailable, it is set to the maximum of 10% of `executorMemory` and `384`.

It sets the internal `executorCores` to link:spark-executor.adoc#spark.executor.cores[spark.executor.cores].

It creates the internal `resource` to Hadoop YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/Resource.html[Resource] with both `executorMemory + memoryOverhead` memory and `executorCores` CPU cores.

It creates the internal `launcherPool` called *ContainerLauncher* with maximum link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.containerLauncherMaxThreads[spark.yarn.containerLauncherMaxThreads] threads.

It sets the internal `launchContainers` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.launchContainers[spark.yarn.launchContainers].

It sets the internal `labelExpression` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.nodeLabelExpression[spark.yarn.executor.nodeLabelExpression].

It sets the internal `nodeLabelConstructor` to...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME nodeLabelConstructor?

It creates an empty <<hostToLocalTaskCounts, hostToLocalTaskCounts>> collection of...FIXME

It sets the internal `numLocalityAwareTasks` counter to `0`.

It sets the internal `containerPlacementStrategy` to...FIXME

`releasedContainers` contains containers of no use anymore by their globally unique identifier https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ContainerId.html[ContainerId] (for a `Container` in the cluster).

NOTE: Hadoop YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/Container.html[Container] represents an allocated resource in the cluster. The YARN ResourceManager is the sole authority to allocate any `Container` to applications. The allocated `Container` is always on a single node and has a unique `ContainerId`. It has a specific amount of `Resource` allocated.
