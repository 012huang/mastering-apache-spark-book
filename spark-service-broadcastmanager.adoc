== [[BroadcastManager]] BroadcastManager

*Broadcast Manager* (`BroadcastManager`) is a Spark service to manage link:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast values] in Spark jobs. It is created for a Spark application as part of link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext's initialization] and is a simple wrapper around <<BroadcastFactory, BroadcastFactory>>.

Broadcast Manager tracks the number of broadcast values (using the internal field `nextBroadcastId`).

The idea is to transfer values used in transformations from a driver to executors in a most effective way so they are copied once and used many times by tasks (rather than being copied every time a task is launched).

When `BroadcastManager` is initialized an instance of <<BroadcastFactory, BroadcastFactory>> is created based on <<spark_broadcast_factory, spark.broadcast.factory>> setting.

=== [[BroadcastFactory]] BroadcastFactory

`BroadcastFactory` is a pluggable interface for broadcast implementations in Spark. It is exclusively used and instantiated inside of `BroadcastManager` to manage broadcast variables.

It comes with 4 methods:

* `def initialize(isDriver: Boolean, conf: SparkConf, securityMgr: SecurityManager): Unit`
* `def newBroadcast[T: ClassTag](value: T, isLocal: Boolean, id: Long): Broadcast[T]` - called after `SparkContext.broadcast()` has been called.
* `def unbroadcast(id: Long, removeFromDriver: Boolean, blocking: Boolean): Unit`
* `def stop(): Unit`

NOTE: link:spark-TorrentBroadcastFactory.adoc[TorrentBroadcastFactory] is the only one implementation of `BroadcastFactory`.

=== [[compression]][[CompressionCodec]] Compression

With <<settings, spark.broadcast.compress>> enabled (which is the default), link:spark-TorrentBroadcast.adoc[TorrentBroadcast] does compression.

CAUTION: FIXME What's compressed?

.Built-in Compression Codecs
[width="100%",cols="1,1,3",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Alias | Fully-Qualified Class Name | Notes
| `lz4` | `org.apache.spark.io.LZ4CompressionCodec` | The default implementation
| `snappy` | `org.apache.spark.io.SnappyCompressionCodec` | The fallback when the default codec is not available.
| `lzf` | `org.apache.spark.io.LZFCompressionCodec` |
|======================

An implementation of `CompressionCodec` trait has to offer a constructor that accepts link:spark-configuration.adoc[SparkConf].
