== Broadcast Manager

*Broadcast Manager* is a Spark service to manage broadcast values in Spark jobs. It is created for a Spark application as part of SparkContext's initialization and is a simple wrapper around <<BroadcastFactory, BroadcastFactory>>.

Broadcast Manager tracks the number of broadcast values (using the internal field `nextBroadcastId`).

The idea is to transfer values used in transformations from a driver to executors in a most effective way so they are copied once and used many times by tasks (rather than being copied every time a task is launched).

When `BroadcastManager` is initialized an instance of `BroadcastFactory` is created based on <<settings, spark.broadcast.factory>> setting.

=== [[BroadcastFactory]] BroadcastFactory

`BroadcastFactory` is a pluggable interface for broadcast implementations in Spark. It is exclusively used and instantiated inside of `BroadcastManager` to manage broadcast variables.

It comes with 4 methods:

* `def initialize(isDriver: Boolean, conf: SparkConf, securityMgr: SecurityManager): Unit`
* `def newBroadcast[T: ClassTag](value: T, isLocal: Boolean, id: Long): Broadcast[T]` - called after `SparkContext.broadcast()` has been called.
* `def unbroadcast(id: Long, removeFromDriver: Boolean, blocking: Boolean): Unit`
* `def stop(): Unit`

=== [[TorrentBroadcast]] TorrentBroadcast

The `BroadcastManager` implementation used in Spark by default is `org.apache.spark.broadcast.TorrentBroadcast` (see <<settings, spark.broadcast.factory>>). It uses a BitTorrent-like protocol to do the distribution.

`TorrentBroadcastFactory` is the factory of `TorrentBroadcast`-based broadcast values.

When a new broadcast value is created using `SparkContext.broadcast()` method, a new instance of `TorrentBroadcast` is created. It is divided into blocks that are put in link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager].

=== [[compression]] Compression

When <<settings, spark.broadcast.compress>> is `true` (default), compression is used.

There are the following compression codec implementations available:

* `lz4` or `org.apache.spark.io.LZ4CompressionCodec`
* `lzf` or `org.apache.spark.io.LZFCompressionCodec` - a fallback when `snappy` is not available.
* `snappy` or `org.apache.spark.io.SnappyCompressionCodec` - the default implementation

An implementation of `CompressionCodec` trait has to offer a constructor that accepts `SparkConf`.

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.broadcast.factory` (default: `org.apache.spark.broadcast.TorrentBroadcastFactory`) - the fully-qualified class name for the implementation of `BroadcastFactory` interface.
* `spark.broadcast.compress` (default: `true`) - a boolean value whether to use compression or not. See <<compression, Compression>>.
* `spark.io.compression.codec` (default: `snappy`) - compression codec to use. See <<compression, Compression>>.
* `spark.broadcast.blockSize` (default: `4m`) - the size of a block
