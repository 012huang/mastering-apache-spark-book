== ContinuousQuery

`ContinuousQuery` provides an interface for interacting with a query that executes in the background.

A `ContinuousQuery` has a name. It belongs to a single `SQLContext`.

NOTE: `ContinuousQuery` is a Scala trait with the only implementation being link:spark-sql-streamexecution.adoc[StreamExecution]

It can be in two states: active (started) or inactive (stopped). If inactive, it may have transitioned into the state due to an `ContinuousQueryException` (that is available under `exception`).

It tracks current state of all the sources, i.e. `SourceStatus`, as `sourceStatuses`.

There could only be a single link:spark-sql-sink.adoc[Sink] for a `ContinuousQuery` with many `Source`'s.

`ContinuousQuery` can be stopped by `stop` or an exception.
