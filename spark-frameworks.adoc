== Spark Application Frameworks

Spark's application frameworks are libraries (components) that aim at simplifying development of distributed applications on top of Spark.

They further abstract the concept of link:spark-rdd.adoc[RDD] and leverage link:spark-overview.adoc[the resiliency and distribution of the computing platform].

There are the following built-in libraries that all constitute *the Spark platform*:

* link:spark-sql.adoc[Spark SQL]
* link:spark-graphx.adoc[Spark GraphX]
* link:spark-streaming.adoc[Spark Streaming]
* Spark MLlib
