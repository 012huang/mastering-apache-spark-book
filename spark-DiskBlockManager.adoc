== [[DiskBlockManager]] DiskBlockManager

CAUTION: FIXME

DiskBlockManager creates and maintains the logical mapping between logical blocks and physical on-disk locations.

By default, one block is mapped to one file with a name given by its BlockId. It is however possible to have a block map to only a segment of a file.

Block files are hashed among the directories listed in `spark.local.dir` (or in `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS` if set).

CAUTION: FIXME Review me.
