== Schedulable Pool

`Pool` is a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulable] entity that represents a collection of (other) `Pools` or link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManagers].

It requires a name, a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[scheduling mode], initial `minShare` and `weight` when created.

NOTE: An instance of `Pool` is created when link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#initialize[TaskSchedulerImpl is initialized].

NOTE: The link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract] and link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract] both require that their entities have `rootPool` of type `Pool`.

=== [[taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm]] taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm Attribute

Using the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[scheduling mode] (given when a `Pool` object is created), `Pool` selects <<SchedulingAlgorithm, SchedulingAlgorithm>> and sets `taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm`:

* <<FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm, FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm>> for FIFO scheduling mode.
* <<FairSchedulingAlgorithm, FairSchedulingAlgorithm>> for FAIR scheduling mode.

It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when unsupported scheduling mode is passed on:

```
Unsupported spark.scheduler.mode: [schedulingMode]
```

TIP: Read about the scheduling modes in link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc[SchedulingMode].

NOTE: `taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm` is used in <<getSortedTaskSetQueue, getSortedTaskSetQueue>>.

=== [[addSchedulable]] addSchedulable

NOTE: `addSchedulable` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

`addSchedulable` adds a `Schedulable` to the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[schedulableQueue] and <<schedulableNameToSchedulable, schedulableNameToSchedulable>>.

More importantly, it sets the `Schedulable` entity's link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[parent] to itself.

=== [[getSortedTaskSetQueue]] getSortedTaskSetQueue

NOTE: `getSortedTaskSetQueue` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

`getSortedTaskSetQueue` sorts all the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulables] in link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[schedulableQueue] queue by a <<SchedulingAlgorithm, SchedulingAlgorithm>> (from the internal <<taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm, taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm>>).

=== [[schedulableNameToSchedulable]] Schedulable lookups by Name (schedulableNameToSchedulable registry)

`Pool` maintains `schedulableNameToSchedulable` which is the mapping between `Schedulable` names to the `Schedulable` objects themselves.

Beside the uses in housekeeping methods like `addSchedulable`, `removeSchedulable`, `getSchedulableByName` from the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract], it is exclusively used in link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#getPoolForName[SparkContext.getPoolForName].

=== [[SchedulingAlgorithm]] SchedulingAlgorithm

`SchedulingAlgorithm` is the interface for a sorting algorithm to sort link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulables].

There are currently two `SchedulingAlgorithms`:

* <<FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm, FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm>> for FIFO scheduling mode.
* <<FairSchedulingAlgorithm, FairSchedulingAlgorithm>> for FAIR scheduling mode.

==== [[FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm]] FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm

`FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm` is a scheduling algorithm that compares `Schedulables` by their `priority` first and, when equal, by their `stageId`.

NOTE: `priority` and `stageId` are part of link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

CAUTION: FIXME _A picture is worth a thousand words._ How to picture the algorithm?

==== [[FairSchedulingAlgorithm]] FairSchedulingAlgorithm

`FairSchedulingAlgorithm` is a scheduling algorithm that compares `Schedulables` by their `minShare`, `runningTasks`, and `weight`.

NOTE: `minShare`, `runningTasks`, and `weight` are part of link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

.FairSchedulingAlgorithm

For each input `Schedulable`, `minShareRatio` is computed as `runningTasks` by `minShare` (but at least `1`) while `taskToWeightRatio` is `runningTasks` by `weight`.
