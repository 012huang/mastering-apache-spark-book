=== [[cacheQuery]] Caching Logical Plan (cacheQuery method)

When you execute link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc#cache[cache] or link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc#persist[persist] methods on a `Dataset`, `cacheQuery` is executed.

[source, scala]
----
cacheQuery(
  query: Dataset[_],
  tableName: Option[String] = None,
  storageLevel: StorageLevel = MEMORY_AND_DISK): Unit
----

`cacheQuery` obtains link:spark-sql-query-execution.adoc#analyzed[analyzed] logical plan. It then saves it as a `InMemoryRelation` in the internal `cachedData` collection.

If the query was already cached, you should instead see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN CacheManager: Asked to cache already cached data.
```
