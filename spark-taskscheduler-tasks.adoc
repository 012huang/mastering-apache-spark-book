== Tasks

*Task* (aka _command_) is an individual unit of work that an link:spark-executor.adoc#launchTask[executor runs on a single machine]. It is represented by <<Task, Task>> abstract class.

.Tasks correspond to partitions in RDD

In other words, a task is a computation on a data partition in a stage in a job attempt.

A task can only belong to one stage and operates on a single partition (that is part of an RDD). All tasks in a stage must be completed before the stages the follow can start.

Tasks are spawned one by one for each stage and partition.

CAUTION: FIXME What are `stageAttemptId` and `taskAttemptId`?

There are two kinds of tasks:

* <<shufflemaptask, ShuffleMapTask>> that executes a task and divides the task's output to multiple buckets (based on the task's partitioner).
* <<ResultTask, ResultTask>> that executes a task and sends the task's output back to the driver application.

The very last stage in a job consists of multiple `ResultTasks`, while earlier stages are a set of <<shufflemaptask, ShuffleMapTasks>>.

=== [[attributes]] Task Attributes

A `Task` instance is uniquely identified by the following task attributes:

* `stageId` - there can be many stages in a job. Every stage has its own unique `stageId` that the task belongs to.

* `stageAttemptId` - a stage can be re-attempted for execution in case of failure. `stageAttemptId` represents the attempt id of a stage that the task belongs to.

* `partitionId` - a task is a unit of work on a partitioned distributed dataset. Every partition has its own unique `partitionId` that a task processes.

* `metrics` - an instance of link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmetrics.adoc[TaskMetrics] for the task.

* `localProperties` - local private properties of the task.

=== [[run]][[execution]] Running Task Thread (run method)

[source, scala]
----
run(
  taskAttemptId: Long,
  attemptNumber: Int,
  metricsSystem: MetricsSystem): T
----

`run` link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#registerTask[registers task attempt id to the executor's BlockManager] and link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc#creating-instance[creates a `TaskContextImpl`] that in turn gets set as the thread local link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc[TaskContext].

If the task has been killed before the task runs it is <<kill, killed>> (with `interruptThread` flag disabled).

The <<runTask, task runs>>.

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `catch` and `finally` blocks.

NOTE: When `run` is called from link:spark-executor-taskrunner.adoc#run[TaskRunner.run], the `Task` has just been deserialized from `taskBytes` that were sent over the wire to an executor. `localProperties` and link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmemorymanager.adoc[TaskMemoryManager] are already assigned.

=== [[runTask]] Running Task (runTask method)

=== [[states]] Task States

A task can be in one of the following states:

* `LAUNCHING`
* `RUNNING` when the task is being started.
* `FINISHED` when the task finished with the serialized result.
* `FAILED` when the task fails, e.g. when `FetchFailedException` (see link:spark-executor.adoc#FetchFailedException[FetchFailedException]), `CommitDeniedException` or any `Throwable` occur
* `KILLED` when an executor kills a task.
* `LOST`

States are the values of `org.apache.spark.TaskState`.

NOTE: Task status updates are sent from executors to the driver through link:spark-executor-backends.adoc[ExecutorBackend].

Task is finished when it is in one of `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, `KILLED`, `LOST`

`LOST` and `FAILED` states are considered failures.

TIP: Task states correspond to https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/include/mesos/mesos.proto[org.apache.mesos.Protos.TaskState].

=== [[collectAccumulatorUpdates]] Collect Latest Values of Accumulators (collectAccumulatorUpdates)

[source, scala]
----
collectAccumulatorUpdates(taskFailed: Boolean = false): Seq[AccumulableInfo]
----

`collectAccumulatorUpdates` collects the latest values of accumulators used in a task (and returns the values as a collection of link:spark-accumulators.adoc#AccumulableInfo[AccumulableInfo]).

NOTE: It is used in link:spark-executor-taskrunner.adoc[TaskRunner] to send a task's final results with the latest values of accumulators used.

When `taskFailed` is `true` it filters out link:spark-accumulators.adoc[accumulators] with `countFailedValues` disabled.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is the check `context != null`?

NOTE: It uses `context.taskMetrics.accumulatorUpdates()`.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `context.taskMetrics.accumulatorUpdates()` doing?

=== [[kill]] Killing Task (kill method)

[source, scala]
----
kill(interruptThread: Boolean)
----

`kill` marks the task to be killed, i.e. it sets the internal `_killed` flag to `true`.

It calls link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc#markInterrupted[TaskContextImpl.markInterrupted] when `context` is set.

If `interruptThread` is enabled and the internal `taskThread` is available, `kill` interrupts it.

CAUTION: FIXME When could `context` and `interruptThread` not be set?

=== [[ShuffleMapTask]][[shufflemaptask]] ShuffleMapTask

A *ShuffleMapTask* divides the elements of an RDD into multiple buckets (based on a partitioner specified in link:spark-rdd-dependencies.adoc#ShuffleDependency[ShuffleDependency]).

=== [[ResultTask]] ResultTask

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[taskMemoryManager]] taskMemoryManager attribute

`taskMemoryManager` is the link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmemorymanager.adoc[TaskMemoryManager] that manages the memory allocated by the task.
